        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
            <h2>Stats</h2>
            <p>Roll for stats: 4d6dr1 or 3d6, or 27 Point Buy. If rolling for stats, please do so in the in-game chat.<br><br>
            Customization/flavoring is allowed and encouraged. If you want something extra just run it by the DM.<br><br>
            Please review the Campaign Rules in case it affects your character.</p>
            <h2>Character Info</h2>
            <p>You are free to play as nobility, but you will be (or at least start as) a very minor noble.<br><br>
            Feel free to name your hometown and describe their location.<br><br>
            <b>Creation Questions that would be helpful to tie in your stories:</b><br>
            What is, or was, your profession (how do, or did, you make a living)?<br>
            Do you have any family? Where do they live and what do they do?<br>
            Does your character have any short and/or long-term goals?</p>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>So, you’re a smalltime human farmer from western Tarmentis that is just starting out adventuring, how would you possibly have learned Elvish, Dwarvish, or Orcish having never seen such creatures? If, for background or RP purposes, you are looking for an alternative, consider these languages:</p>
                <h5>The Trade Language</h5>
                <p>If you can’t think of a valid reason your character might be fluent in another language, and want an alternative, consider selecting The Trade Language. The Trade Language is used by Shop Keepers, Peddlers, buyers, and sellers of many peoples to bridge the gap between races. The Trade Language is not extensive, but it’s a good way to tell an Elf huntsman that doesn’t speak common that you want X amount of rabbits for X amount of copper.</p>
                <h5>Old Common</h5>
                <p>The current iteration of Common happened through years and years of evolution. However, many tomes in the old libraries, parchment found in chests, and madmen scrawling’s in caves are in Old Common. In addition, the old way to say a location might contain a clue or added information about that place. (Requirement: 12 INT or greater).</p>
                <h5>Ancient Dwarven</h5>
                <p>(The ‘Sylvan’ equivalent) Before the rise of humans, Elves ruled the land. However, the deep dark tunnels and caves of the world have always belonged to the dwarves. (Requirement: 12 INT or greater).</p>
                <h5>Thieves Cant</h5>
                <p>The unrepentant thief is not the only one that has a use for the secret language of the underworld. Perhaps you used to be a peddler, and sometimes deal with… items of suspect origin.</p>

            <h2>Equipment and Wealth</h2>
                <h5>Adventuring Gear and Weight</h5>
                <p>All equipment must have a weight value.<br><br>When purchasing or using starting packs, break out each item and give it an appropriate weight value.</p>

                <h5>Wealth and Coin</h5>
                <p>Copper is the default currency of the world, and gold is hard to come by for common folk. You can see a list of professions and estimated earnings <a class="a-inline" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLyzfic7tMikY2rqLjH9qzkPwhd4xuRE/view?usp=drivesdk">here</a>, and purchasable gear and services <a class="a-inline" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11HMcna-hcqKzwUGZCoKHvdosr2A-i0CDNrlri3DjzTk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a><br><br>1 Platinum = 500 copper<br><br>
                Ignore any starting gold you would get from your class, background, or any other source.<br><br>Starting wealth = (3d8+6 Silver (x2 Copper))*level.  A roll of 19 = 19 Silver 38 Copper starting wealth.  If you are starting at level 2, you would double that amount.</p>

        <h1>Race Changes and Restrictions</h1>
        <p>Inhabitants of civilization in Rymura consist primarily of humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes. Other intelligent races are known to exist but have little contact with the civilized world. They are generally found in the wilder places of the continents.<br><br>*Roleplaying as one of these races will affect how people treat and react to you, the more “human/humanoid” you look, the more “normal” the reaction from the general populace. For instance, if you play a Hobgoblin and go into a northern village, you will most likely be met with fear and hostility. In the South you may be treated with wonder and disbelief. I am not trying to discourage you from playing a race, just be prepared from a roleplay point of view.*<br><br>Please review the below list when selecting a race, or subrace, for possible changes or restrictions. If you want to play a race, or use a feature that has been restricted, please let me know and I will work with you.<br><br>If the Race/Subrace you are taking is not in the PHB, XGE, SCAG, VGtM, MToF, or TCoE, please okay it with the DM</p>
