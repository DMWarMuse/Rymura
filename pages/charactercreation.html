        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
            <h2>Stats</h2>
            <p>Roll for stats: 4d6dr1 or 3d6, or 27 Point Buy. If rolling for stats, please do so in the in-game chat.<br>
                Customization/flavoring is allowed and encouraged, if you want something extra just run it by the DM.<br>
                Please review the Campaign Rules in case it effects your character.</p>
            <h2>Character Info</h2>
            <p>You are free to play as nobility, but you will be (or at least start as) a very minor noble.<br><br>
                Feel free to name your hometowns and describe their location.<br><br>
                <b>Creation Questions that would be helpful to tie in your stories:</b><br>
                What is or was your profession (how do or did you make a living)?<br>
                Do you have any family? Where do they live and what do they do?<br>
                Does your characters short and/or long-term goals?</p>
            <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>So, you’re a smalltime human farmer from western Tarmentis that is just starting out adventuring, how would you possibly
                have learned Elvish, Dwarvish, or Orcish having never seen such creatures? If, for background or RP purposes, you are
                looking for an alternative, consider these languages:</p>
                <h5>The Trade Language</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">If you can’t think of a valid reason your character might be fluent in another language, and want an
                alternative, consider selecting The Trade Language. The Trade Language is used by Shop Keepers, Peddlers, buyers, and
                sellers of many peoples to bridge to gap between races. The Trade Language is not extensive, but it’s a good way to tell
                an Elf huntsman that doesn’t speak common that you want X amount of rabbits for X amount of copper.</p>
                <h5>Old Common</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">The current iteration of Common happened through years and years of evolution, however, many tomes
                in the old libraries, parchment found in chests, and madmen scrawling’s in caves are in Old Common. In addition, the old
                way to say a location might contain a clue or added information for that place. (Requirement: 12 INT or greater).</p>
                <h5>Ancient Dwarven</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">(The ‘Sylvan’ equivalent) Before the rise of humans, Elves ruled the land. However, the deep dark
                tunnels and caves of the world have always belonged to the dwarves. (Requirement: 12 INT or greater).</p>
                <h5>Thieves Cant</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">The unrepentant thief is not the only one that have a use for the secret language of the underworld.
                Perhaps you used to be a peddler, and sometimes deal with… items of suspect origin.</p>
            <h2>Equipment and Wealth</h2>
                <h5>Weapons</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">Spears and javelins now have the finesse tag.</p>
                <p class="p-h5">Crossbow does not require a proficiency slot to use.</p>
                <h5>Adventuring Gear and Weight</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">All equipment must have a weight value. When purchasing or using starting packs, break out each item and give it the appropriate weight value.</p>
                <h5>Wealth and Coin</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">Copper is the default currency, gold is hard to come by for common folk.  You can see a list of professions, services, and gear prices <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Movement and Swimming</h2>
                <h5>Movement</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">A character may only dash once per round, regardless of the source of the dash. For example, a rogue may move, attack, and bonus action dash, but may not move, bonus action dash, action dash. Expeditious Retreat is the exception to this and permits one additional dash. Haste already increases your speed, so it does not allow any additional dashes.</p>
                <h5>Swimming</h5>
                <p class="p-h5">Swimming is heavily impacted by encumbrance. A character may swim normally as long as they are carrying weight less than or equal to their strength score. They may tread water if they have weight greater than their strength score, but less than or equal to twice their strength. If a character has more weight on them than twice their strength score, they swim 5ft per round and must sink. Do not count buoyant gear in this calculation (wooden staff, water skin, etc.).
                    <br><br>≤ Str | Normal swimming
                    <br>> Str | Tread water
                    <br>> Str x2 | Swim 5ft, only sink</p>
