        <h1> The Warrens </h1>
          <p>Clerical and Magical energies permeate the world through founts of the forces, powers, and components of the
              Prime Material Plane. These forces were there during the infancy of the world; pure, and present in all things.<br><br>

              Each source dwells inside a Warren (sometimes called a House or Hold). These Warrens are sub-plane repositories;
              pure representations of the power that resides within. Venture into the Warren of Order and you will be treated to
              straight lines, uniformity, and predictability, where-as the Warren of Purity is a vast un-marked snow-covered
              landscape of peace and contentment.<br><br>

              Each Warren is overseen by an effigy the reflects the power that that Warren is composed of. The Warren of Fate, for example, is presided over by The Inexorable; A being of unstoppable inevitability. The Warren of Destruction, on the other hand, is presided over by The Architect of Ruin; worried about nothing else other than the complete dismantling of all things. These effigies are kept in check by the others in a delicate dance of balance, and they rarely turn their attention outside of their own dominion.<br><br>
              The raw power of a Warren is too much for standard mortals to harness and control; while incredible feats can be performed, in the end the body and mind will shatter. Paragons, Exemplars, and other Higher beings, known colloquially as Gods, temper the flow of the Warrens and disseminate its power to its users.<br><br>

              <i>"The Warrens of the world dwell beyond the planes. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes."</i>― Tattersail</p>

            <div>

              <h2>Agrinor</h2>
              <p><em>God of Suffering, Plague and Pestilence</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The corrupter of flesh.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Locust Leg<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Poisoners, Torturers, Malcontents: Not worshiped in the open.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Besides being invoked as a curse against someone whom you don’t like, Agrinor is not talked about in polite conversation.  The superstition is that voicing his name will bring ruin and despair down upon you.  He delights in designing new plagues and sending them out into the world.</p>

              <h2>Amys</h2>
              <p><em>Goddess of Divinations</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Pulled Thread.</br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Crystal Orb</br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Scholars, Bone Casters, Fortune Tellers.</br>
              <u>Description:</u> Believed to have been lost, or at least extremely weakened, in the Frist Battle of Heavens Fall; the use of tarot cards and bone casters hinted that Amys might have retained her power and gone into hiding.  This was proven accurate after she appeared to, and helped, the Stone Bearers in their fight against Tarmeer in the events preceding The Second Battle of Heavens Fall some 1600 years later.</p>

              <h2>Astalon</h2>
              <p><em>Deceased <s>God of Law, Order, and Justice</s></em></p>

              <p><em>God of Thieves and Masks</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Weighted Dice.</br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Inverted Triangle with Circled Point</br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Thieves, Con-men, Spy’s.</br>
              <u>Description:</u>Those who primarily deal in deception, thievery, and lies worship Banath.  You will likely never see his holy symbol displayed out in the open, unless you know where to look.  Tithes are sometimes offered at the church of Banath in an effort to ward off thieves and protect cargo.</p>

              <h2>Byron</h2>
              <p><em>God of Artisans and Inspiration</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The great entertainer.  The tireless worker.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Harp or Smiths Hammer.<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Entertainers such as writers, poets, artists, and actors, as well as artisans such as carpenters, stonemasons, wheelwrights, and blacksmiths.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> The followers of Byron are staunchly devoted.  Worshipers believe their art or craft lives and dies at his will.  Dwarves and blacksmiths see Byron as the forge master, they invoke his name when trying to make items of special significance or certain prominence.</p>

              <h2>Dicium</h2>
              <p><em>God of Law and Obedience</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Iron Hand.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Three Vertical Bars in Parallel<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Kings, Nobility, Executioners, Constables, Barristers.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Eldest sister of Somniatella and Vora.  Originally a Goddess of Death and Judgement during the Time of Turmoil, Dicium released the sole moniker of death to Kulindra and took up the mantle of law after Astalon was slain by The Unbound One in The Second Battle of Heavens Fall.</p>

              <h2>Dubh Catha</h2>
              <p><em>Lord of the Shadowfell</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> Lord of Black, The Dark Crow<br>

              <h3>Agents:</h3>
              <p>Jaggerjack:  Located in the Prime Material Plane, Jaggerjack belongs to a sect of Firbolgs who are far more militaristic and violent then their nature inclined cousins.  He was one of the Stone Bearers and escaped The Second Battle of Heavens Fall with the help of Dubh Catha.  Jaggerjack is now a Darkling highbred who leads an army of Firbolgs and Darklings serving Dubh Catha’s will.  </p>

              <h2>Dulmarth</h2>
              <p><em>God of Protection, Courage, and Self-Sacrifice</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> Shield of the Weak.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> White Heater Shield.<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Downtrodden, urchins, orphanages, some soldiers.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Brother of Kelmarik, Dulmarth is prayed to for protection from harm by those who have seen the worst in the world.  He is also turned to by soldiers who plan on sacrificing themselves for the good of others; they pray for a noble and heroic end.  Dulmarth is often seen with El Morin.</p>

              <h2>El-Morin</h2>
              <p><em>Goddess of Winter, Solitude, and Loss</em></p>

              <u>Symbol:</u> Blue Snowflake<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Outcasts, wanderers, hermits, and those that enjoy solitude.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Sister to Kirallin, the goddess of winter is typically worshipped by hermits and those that cherish the solitude and silence of night.  Many say a prayer to El-Morin during the Midwinter festival.  Seen as neither benevolent nor malicious.</p>

              <h3>Agents:</h3>
              <p>Saint Silindus – The Rear Guard:  Saint Silindus was one of the adventurers that catalyzed the Second Battle of Heavens Fall.  After falling in battle at the Temple of the Three Sisters, El Morin and Dulmarth recruited him to their service in exchange for allowing The Order of the White River to reside in the Warren of Purity.  Silindus now serves Dulmarth as he sends him out into the Prime Material Plane to assist those who are worthy.</p>

              <h2>Einhasad</h2>
              <p><em>God of The Hunt.</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Red Jawed Hunter.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Arrow Knocked Bow<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Hunters, scouts, rangers, and those affected with Lycanthropy.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Einhasad has been represented as both a man and a wolf.  Hunters ask for his blessing when taking a killing shot, and scouts say a prayer that they will remain hidden.  Because of old scripture describing Einhasad as a wolf, he is also worshiped by those afflicted with lycanthropy.</p>

              <h2>Eva</h2>
              <p><em>Goddess of Farming and Agriculture.</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> Lady Spring.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Sheaf of Wheat<br>
