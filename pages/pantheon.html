            <h1>Description of Gods and Saints</h1>
            <p><i>The Following are short descriptions of the Gods of Rymura (and extraplanar gods): Listed Alphabetically.<br>More detailed descriptions and write-ups are available if interested.</i></p>
            <div>

              <h2>Agrinor the Unclean</h2>
              <p><em>Saint of Suffering and Pestilence</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Corrupter of Flesh<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Locust Leg<br>

              <u>Description:</u> Agrinor was an alchemist in the thriving city of Halcyon where he made his living selling concoctions to cure the many ailments that were prevalent in the Halcyon society. As the city continued to expand and prosper, the divide between poor and elite grew; deadlier sicknesses began to run rampant in the destitute areas of Halcyon, killing its citizens in droves. The people went to the nobles and chancellors for aid, but the wealthy would do nothing to help the poor souls who were being affected.<br><br>
              Enraged by this injustice, Agrinor infected himself with a particularly deadly sickness before going to a gala that would be attended by many of the influential personages of Halcyon. Within weeks the plague had devastated the city's elites causing their flesh to corrupt, bloat, and wither. Soon the entire city was sick and dying except for the poor whom Agrinor had inoculated against the disease. The common people hailed Agrinor as a hero and, when he was finally brought to justice, deified him as a Saint of Thystre for providing justice to the corrupt and greedy of the world.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> Agrinor's ordained, few that there are, call themselves Plague Bearers. They believe each disease is a gift and a chance for the inflicted to reflect on how good their lives were. The Plague Bearers seek out areas of disease or sickness and render aid.<br><br>
              <u>Known Sects/Cults:</u> Black Alchemists - As the name would suggest, the members of this sect are underworld Alchemists and Leeches who use their knowledge to help the sick and dying, for a price.</p>

              <h2>Ayms the Sibyl</h2>
              <p><em>Saint of Divination</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Pulled Thread</br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Crystal Orb</br>

              <u>Description:</u> Ayms was a hermit who dwelt on the edge of the ancient kingdom of Kyore where locals would come from near and far to receive her readings and bone castings. However, after the son of a rich merchant had died at the time, and in the way, that Ayms had predicted: Rumblings began that Ayms was the one responsible for the son’s demise. As with most things that touch on the arcane and unknown, the people were soon driven by ignorance and fear as they surrounded the home of Ayms and set fire to its roof. As Ayms burned, suffering in agony, looking out on the faces of those who hated and feared her, she foretold one last vision: A Demon gate was going to be opened by the Cult of the Lidless in an abandoned warehouse in the Capitol of Kyore.<br><br>
              Ayms, with her last words, did not condemn or curse those who murdered her, but instead chose to save untold lives as the Cult of the Lidless was stopped before their plans could come to fruition. The story of Ayms altruism, even in the face of hatred and death, spread across the lands and soon she became known as Ayms the Sibyl, Saint of Tiana.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> Oracles of Ayms are known to possess potent foresight abilities. They are often called upon, or appear, at the crossroads of great decisions that shape future events. They believe that Ayms provides information of what could happen, not what will happen, and that it is up to the individual to use that information, not for the Oracles to intervene.<br>

              <h2>Banath the Master of Masks</h2>
              <p><em>Saint of Thievery</em></p>

              <u>Symbol:</u> Inverted Triangle with Circled Point</br>
              <u>Tenets:</u> Thieves Proser, The Rich must Remember<br>
              <!-- <u>Description: </u>You will likely never see his holy symbol displayed out in the open unless you know where to look. Tithes are sometimes offered at the church of Banath in an effort to ward off thieves and protect cargo.<br>--><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> The ordained of Banath, called Masks, live by the two tenets: "Thieves Prosper" and "The Rich must Remember". They do their best to help, hide, and support members of the various organizations of thieves.

              <h2>Dulmarth the Cleansed</h2>
              <p><em>Saint of Redemption</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> Shield of the Weak.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> White Heater Shield.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> "A person is better than the worst thing they have done in the world." Dulmarth was a soldier during the siege of Beliskner. By the second month of the siege the city was dying, food was scarce, the dead were piling up, and the writing was on the wall: Beliskner would fall. Bribed by the enemy, Dulmarth betrayed the city and let the attacking army through the gates allowing them to take control of Beliskner. Part of their bargain was to quickly end the assault and allow food and relief to the citizens of the city, the enemy army did not honor that deal: their soldiers sacked the city and killed scores Belisker's people in the streets.<br><br>
              Wracked by guilt for his deed, Dulmarth began a months long crusade against the officers and leaders of the enemy army. He killed captains, generals, and knights before sacrificing himself as the Summit of Three Rivers: Killing the King, the king's wizard, and two advisors. Moved by his personal crusade for justice, Dicium raised him to the rank of Saint.<br><br>

              <u>Description:</u> Einhasad has been represented as both a man and a wolf. Hunters ask for his blessing when taking a killing shot, and scouts say a prayer that they will remain hidden. Because of old scripture describing Einhasad as a wolf, he is also worshiped by those afflicted with lycanthropy.<br><br>
              Einhasad was a Druid who led an army of beasts against the then Rumari Empire when they tried to expand their territory into the Black Forest, even awaking tree and shrub to fight the invaders, eventually turning them back and out of the Black Forest. Though losing his life in the final days of the fight, Einhasad's magic lingers and has transformed the once peaceful forest into The Creeping Wode that still persists today. Salix, the God of Nature, took Einhasad into his domain and anointed him Einhasad the Preserver, Saint of Untamed Wilderness.
              <br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> The Hunters of Einhasad are skilled members of the church that everyday citizens can petition to take care of random and roving beasts who stray too close to centers of civilization.

              <u>Known Sects/Cults:</u> The Divine Teeth - A group of lycanthropes who seek out and destroy evil. They will also destroy those who have been affected with the "gift" of lycanthropy but give in to their baser urges.</p>

  <!-- <h1> Chaos and Order </h1>
          <p>In the beginning, the surface of Terrim was lifeless. Above the heavens two powerful begins struggled.  They did not struggle with malicious intent, or with hate, hope, fear, envy or any such feeling the way mere mortals comprehend things.  They struggled against each other because that is what they were there to do.  Laither - She who is order and Relthar - He who is chaos, the two blind gods of the beginning.  Laither in her infinite prowess would grab the strands of life and magic and braid then into orderly lines, while Relthar unbraided them as was his nature.  Sometimes Laither missed strands of lifeforce and they would filter down the surface of Terrim, where they made contact, life grew.-->
        <!-- <h1> The Warrens </h1>
          <p>Clerical and Magical energies permeate the world through founts of the forces, powers, and components that make up the
              Prime Material Plane. These forces were there during the infancy of the world; pure, and present in all things.<br><br>

              Each source dwells inside a Warren (sometimes called a House or Hold). These Warrens are sub-plane repositories;
              pure representations of the power that resides within. Venture into the Warren of Order and you will be treated to
              straight lines, uniformity, and predictability, where-as the Warren of Purity is a vast un-marked snow-covered
              landscape of peace and contentment.<br><br>

              Each Warren is overseen by an effigy that reflects the power that that Warren is composed of. The Warren of Fate, for example, is presided over by The Inexorable; A being of unstoppable inevitability. The Warren of Destruction, on the other hand, is presided over by The Architect of Ruin; worried about nothing else other than the complete dismantling of all things. These effigies are kept in check by the others in a delicate dance of balance, and they rarely turn their attention outside of their own dominion.<br><br>
              The raw power of a Warren is too much for standard mortals to harness and control; while incredible feats can be performed, in the end the body and mind will shatter. Paragons, Exemplars, and other Higher beings, known colloquially as Gods, temper the flow of the Warrens and disseminate its power to its users.<br><br>

              <i>"The Warrens of the world dwell beyond the planes. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes." ― Tattersail</i></p>
