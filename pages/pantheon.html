        <!-- <h1> Chaos and Order </h1>
          <p>In the beginning, the surface of Terrim was lifeless. Above the heavens two powerful begins struggled.  They did not struggle with malicious intent, or with hate, hope, fear, envy or any such feeling the way mere mortals comprehend things.  They struggled against each other because that is what they were there to do.  Laither - She who is order and Relthar - He who is chaos, the two blind gods of the beginning.  Laither in her infinite prowess would grab the strands of life and magic and braid then into orderly lines, while Relthar unbraided them as was his nature.  Sometimes Laither missed strands of lifeforce and they would filter down the surface of Terrim, where they made contact, life grew.-->
        <!-- <h1> The Warrens </h1>
          <p>Clerical and Magical energies permeate the world through founts of the forces, powers, and components that make up the
              Prime Material Plane. These forces were there during the infancy of the world; pure, and present in all things.<br><br>

              Each source dwells inside a Warren (sometimes called a House or Hold). These Warrens are sub-plane repositories;
              pure representations of the power that resides within. Venture into the Warren of Order and you will be treated to
              straight lines, uniformity, and predictability, where-as the Warren of Purity is a vast un-marked snow-covered
              landscape of peace and contentment.<br><br>

              Each Warren is overseen by an effigy that reflects the power that that Warren is composed of. The Warren of Fate, for example, is presided over by The Inexorable; A being of unstoppable inevitability. The Warren of Destruction, on the other hand, is presided over by The Architect of Ruin; worried about nothing else other than the complete dismantling of all things. These effigies are kept in check by the others in a delicate dance of balance, and they rarely turn their attention outside of their own dominion.<br><br>
              The raw power of a Warren is too much for standard mortals to harness and control; while incredible feats can be performed, in the end the body and mind will shatter. Paragons, Exemplars, and other Higher beings, known colloquially as Gods, temper the flow of the Warrens and disseminate its power to its users.<br><br>

              <i>"The Warrens of the world dwell beyond the planes. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes." ― Tattersail</i></p>

            <p><i>The Following are short descriptions of the Gods of Rymura (and extraplanar gods): Listed Alphabetically.<br>More detailed descriptions and write-ups of gods are available if interested. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbOMA8kFkXLG4B1auYSfGe9bAyznJS_t/view?usp=sharing">Example Here</a></i></p>
            <div>

              <h2>Agrinor</h2>
              <p><em>God of Suffering, Plague, and Pestilence</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The corrupter of flesh<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Locust Leg<br>
              <!-- <u>Tenets:</u> Suffering provides<br> !-->
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Poisoners, Torturers, some Alchemists and Healers: Generally not worshiped in the open.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Besides being invoked as a curse against someone whom you don’t like, Agrinor is not talked about in polite conversation.  The superstition is that voicing his name will bring ruin and despair down upon you and your loved ones. Agrinors followers believe that when a land gets too corrupt, its people to pompous, or stray too far from the light of the gods, he will remind them of their place with a plague or devastation.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> Agrinor's ordained, few that there are, call themselves Plague Bearers.  They think each disease, sickness, or devastation is a gift and a chance for the inflicted to reflect on how good their lives were, benefiting from the added perspective of an imminent death that only Agrinor could give them. The Plague Bearers delight in designing new plagues and sending them out into the world: reminding the races that they are mortal and not above the gods.<br><br>
              <u>Known Sects/Cults:</u> Black Alchemists - As the name would suggest, the members of this sect are underworld Alchemists and Leeches. They usually use their knowledge to help the sick and dying, for a price, believing that Agrinor only intends his subjects to suffer, not die.</p>

              <h2>Amys</h2>
              <p><em>Goddess of Divinations</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Pulled Thread</br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> A Crystal Orb</br>
              <!-- <u>Tenets:</u> The quest given<br> !-->
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Scholars, Bone Casters, Fortune Tellers.</br>
              <u>Description:</u> Amys often sends visions, glimpses of the possible futures, to some in order to nudge the outcome of an event in her desired direction. When Deja Vu is witnessed it is believed that Amys is nearby paying direct attention to whatever events are unfolding.<br>Believed to have been lost, or at least extremely weakened, in the First Battle of Heavens Fall; the use of tarot cards and bone casters hinted that Amys might have retained her power and gone into hiding.  This was proven accurate after she appeared to, and helped, the Stone Bearers in their fight against Tarmeer in the events preceding The Second Battle of Heavens Fall some years later.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> Oracles of Amys are known to possess potent foresight abilities. They are often called upon, or appear, at the crossroads of great decisions that shape future events. They believe that Amys provides information of what could happen, not what will happen, and that it is up to the individual to use that information, not for the Oracles to intervene.<br><br>
              <!-- <u>Known Sects/Cults:</u>!--> </p>

              <h2>Banath</h2>
              <p><em>God of Thieves and Masks</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Weighted Dice.</br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Inverted Triangle with Circled Point</br>
              <u>Tenets:</u> Thieves Proser, The Rich must Remember<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u>  Thieves, Con-men, Spy’s.</br>
              <u>Description: </u>Those who primarily deal in deception, thievery, and lies worship Banath.  You will likely never see his holy symbol displayed out in the open unless you know where to look.  Tithes are sometimes offered at the church of Banath in an effort to ward off thieves and protect cargo.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> The ordained of Banath (Called Masks) live by the two tenets: "Thieves Prosper" and "The Rich must Remember". They do their best to help, and hide, members of the various brotherhoods of thieves, and to remind the privileged of the world that they are not gods; dealing out what could be their only punishment this side of divine retribution.</p>

              <h2>Byron</h2>
              <p><em>God of Artisans and Inspiration</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Blacksmith Poet. The Tireless Worker<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Harp or Smiths Hammer.<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Entertainers such as writers, poets, artists, and actors, as well as artisans such as carpenters, stonemasons, wheelwrights, and blacksmiths.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> The followers of Byron are staunchly devoted.  Worshipers believe their art or craft lives and dies at his will.  Blacksmiths see Byron as the forge master, they invoke his name when trying to make items of special significance or certain prominence.</p>

              <h2>Dicium</h2>
              <p><em>God of Law and Obedience</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> The Iron Hand.<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Three Vertical Bars in Parallel<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Kings, Nobility, Executioners, Constables, Barristers.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Eldest sister of Somniatella and Vora.  Originally a Goddess of Death and Judgement during the Time of Turmoil, Dicium released the sole moniker of death to Kulindra and took up the mantle of law after Astalon was slain by The Unbound One in The Second Battle of Heavens Fall.<br><br>
              <u>The Ordained:</u> Adjudicators of Dicium routinely travel to outlying villages and hamlets and help settle disputes or act as judges.  Adjudicators can also be requested during court proceedings as they are known to be impartial in their judgement.</p>

              <h2>Dubh Catha</h2>
              <p><em>Lord of the Shadowfell</em></p>
              <p><u>Maxim:</u> Lord of Black, The Dark Crow<br>
              <u>Symbol:</u> Crow head in profile<br>
              <u>Common Followers:</u> Darklings, some Firbolgs, other denizens of the Shadowfell.<br>
              <u>Description:</u> Cast out of Queen Tatiana’s court in the Feywild.  Dubh Catha quickly became feared in the Shadowfells.  Together with his Darkling brethren, he builds his power for his inevitable strike against the Feywild and Tatiana.  He is at odds with The Raven Queen as she too wishes to control the Shadowfell.<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbOMA8kFkXLG4B1auYSfGe9bAyznJS_t/view?usp=sharing">More Info</a></p>
