        <h1 data-toc-text="Table of Contents" style="text-align: center;">Lucera Survival Rules</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0px;">The continent of Lucera is a cold and unforgiving place.  Scavaging for food, keeping warm, and keeping your companions alive are essential for survival during your expedition.  Please review the below rules that are specific to the lands of Lucera.</p>
      </header>

        <nav class="toc" id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav>
      </div>

      <div class="gcontent" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <h1>Cold Weather and Warmth Points</h1>
        <p>Lucera is cold. Very cold. The kind of cold that will steal your warmth from your bones, and when the wind blows it only gets worse.<br><br>
            You start with a number of Warmth Points (wp) equal to your CON score.  During the day as you travel, hunt for food, or explore ruins, your warmth points decrease depending on the weather and other environmental variables.</p>

            <h2>Weather Penalties</h2>
            <p>Calm or Light = -1 wp/hour<br>
            Moderate = -2 wp/hour<br>
            Severe = -4 wp/hour<br>
            Wet = -6 wp/hour, takes 3 hours to dry out<br><br>

            Once your character reaches 0 warmth points, your Speed is halved, and you have Disadvantage on ability checks that rely on Constitution, Strength, or Dexterity.<br><br>
            If you remain in the elements after your warmth points have dropped to 0, you will begin to lose CON at the rate of -1/hour.<br><br>
            If your CON reaches 0, you die.<br>
            You regain 1 CON per Long Rest.<br><br>

            If you are caught outside during Severe weather (Blizzard/Ice Storm) the environment will make a 1d4 attack against your warmth points. If you have no warmth points remaining, the attack is made against your CON.</p>

            <h2>Shelter</h2>
            <p>Tents, caves, buildings, and other kinds of shelter will decrease the amount of Warmth Points lost per hour. However, shelter alone will never bring your warmth points lost per hour above 0.<br><br>

                Canvas Tent, Shallow Caves, or Dilapidated Buildings = +1<br>
                Fur Tent or Basic Buildings = +2<br>
                Deep Caves, or Solid Buildings (fort/castle) will set the warmth points lost per hour to 0.</p>

            <h2>Regaining Warmth Points</h2>
            <p>A fire is necessary to regain warmth points. The amount of warmth points gained depends on the amount of firewood your burn (in lbs).<br><br>

               Pounds of wood burned per hour:<br>
                2 lbs = +1 warmth point/hour<br>
                3 lbs = +2 warmth points/hour<br>
                4 lbs = +3 warmth points/hour<br><br>

              Weather that is Moderate requires, at least, a windbreak in order to start a fire and gain benefit from it.  You will not be able to benefit from a fire during Severe weather without some from of shelter.</p>

            <h2>Other Modifiers</h2>
            <p>Quality winter gear will increase your pool of Warmth Points.  A heavy fur cloak (20 lbs) for example, will increase your Warmth Points by +5.<br><br>

            Being burned, while not fun or good for your overall health, will regain warmth points.</p>

            <h5>Examples</h5>
            <p>Calm or light day (-1):<br>
                Canvas Tent (+1) + 2lb fire (+1) = +1wp/hour<br>
                No Shelter + 3lb fire (+2) = +1wp/hour<br><br>

                Moderate day (-2):<br>
                Canvas Tent (+1) + 3lb fire (+2) = +1wp/hour<br>
                Wind Break (+0) + 4lb fire (+3) = +1wp/hour<br><br>

                Severe Weather (-4):<br>
                Fur Tent (+2) + 4lb fire (+3) = +1wp/hour<br>
                Deep Cave(set to 0) + 2lb fire (+1) = +1wp/hour
            </p>

        <h1>Collecting Firewood</h1>
        <p>Fire is essential to survival in this frigid waste.  Make sure you keep a healthy supply of firewood nearby to increase your chances of living.<br><br>
            A Strength check will be requied when harvesting firewood.  On your roll, for every number greater than the DC (base DC 10), you gain that many pounds of firewood.<br><br>

            For example, a Strength roll of 22 on a DC 10 check would result in 12 pounds of firewood.<br><br>

            Each Strength Check for firewood takes 1 hour.</p>

            <h2>Modifiers</h2>
            <p>The correct tool is important for efficient wood gathering.<br><br>
                Daggers, Maces, or other ill-suited weapon = Disadvantage on Strength check<br>
                Swords, Halberds, or equivalent bladed weapon = x1 wood harvested<br>
                Hand Axe, or Battle Axe = x2 wood harvested<br>
                Wood Axe = x3 wood harvested</p>

        <h1>Gathering Food</h1>
        <p>Scavaging or Hunting for food is crucial for keeping yourself fed in the harsh environment of Lucera where resupplies from Rymura are weeks away.<br><br>
            A Survival check is required when foraging for food, for every number greater than the DC (DC varies by area), you gain that many pounds of food.<br><br>

            A Survival check of 22 on a DC18 check would net 4 pounds of food.<br>
            Each Survival check foraging for food takes 1 hour.<br>
            If you are not profiecient in Survival, roll at disadvantage.<br>
            2 pounds of food per day are needed to sustain your character.</p>

            <h2>Other Sources of Food</h2>
            <p>There are other ways to stock up on your rations other than foraging.  Fishing near the shore, hunting seal or walrus, or coming across a heard of caribou are all viable sources of obtaining food.  The pounds of food obtained by hunting depends on the kill.</p>

        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <p>These travel rules are in addition to the ones found on the <a href="campaignrules.html#travel">Campaign Rules Page</a>.<br> Travel Pace assumes an 8 hour day and non-rough terrain:<br><br>
            On Foot = 3d10+6 miles (Low = 9, Avg = 22.5, High = 36)<br>
            Other forms of travel will need to be discovered or obtained.</p>
            <h6>Luceran Weather Modifiers:</h6>
                <p>Severe Weather (Total distance x.5)<br>
                Traveling during a blizzard requires a DC15 survival check: On a failure, you veer off-course.</p>

        <h1>Requisition and Ordering Supplies</h1>
        <p>You will find no stores, shops, or services in the desolate lands of Lucera. Instead, supplies and gear must be crafted, ordered, or requisitioned.</p>
            <h2>Requisitons</h2>
            <p>The Base Camp will have some supplies on hand.  You may try to requisition these supplies from the acting quartermaster.</p>
            <h2>Ordering Supplies</h2>
            <p>The ship that has brought you to these shores has been hired to make scheduled stops.  You may order supplies when the ship arrives, and when they get back to Rymura they will do their best to purchase the items requested.  However, The journey is long and it will be 6-8 weeks before the ship returns, hopefully with your supplies.  You will have to plan ahead and think of what you may need in the coming weeks.<br><br>
            If you are lookng for less savory items, you may want to find a trused contact on the ship that could make and deliver those purchases for you.</p>
            <h2>Obtaining Wealth</h2>
            <p>During your expeditions you will come across various objects of interest that could be sold for to the right person.  This is how you will obtain your wealth in order to purchase supplies, improve the base camp, and hire craftmen to aid you in your expedition.</p>
