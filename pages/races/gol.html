      <h1>Gol of Rymura</h1>
        <p>Humanoid race hailing from Gremoria, the land of monsters. The Gol are closely related to humans but are known for their impressive stature, standing taller and broader than your average human, and having more robust physiques. The Gol have exceptional endurance and resilience, allowing them to endure physical hardships, resist fatigue, and push themselves beyond normal limits in combat and other strenuous activities.<br><br>
        Though pseudo-nomadic, most of their settlements have earth and wood berms and walls to help defend them against their monstrous neighbors (minotaur, giants, etc.).<br><br>
        Honor is a cornerstone of Gol society, and individuals are judged based on their actions, integrity, and adherence to tribal codes of conduct. Challenges and duels are common ways to settle disputes and uphold honor.<br><br>
        All Gol share the following racial traits:
       </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Gol are considered an adult on their thirteenth birthday and live similar spans as humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> While taller and broader than a human, your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>
            <li><strong>Superior Endurance.</strong> You are able to push yourself onward where others would collapse, you regain 1 Hit Die at the end of a Short Rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Survival Instincts.</strong> Growing up in nomadic tribes has honed the Gol's survival instincts. You have proficiency in Survival checks, and advantage on tracking, foraging, and navigating wilderness terrain.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Giant, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Blood of Abartach</h2>
              <p>The Blood of Abartach are renowned for their passionate and fiery temperament. They are fierce warriors who excel in combat, relying on their strength and aggression to overwhelm foes. Many of the Abartach have small horn-like nodules that protrude from their face.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Menacing.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</li>
                  <li><strong>Unfettered Rage.</strong> Upon becoming Bloodied (half health) you become enraged and gain the following benefits which last until the end of combat:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 5 x your proficiency bonus.</li>
                      <li>Your speed increases by 10ft per round.</li>
                      <li>You gain advantage in Constitution and Strength saving throws.</li>
                      <li>You shrug off the effects of any charm or fear you are currently under.</li>
                      <li>Once you use your Unfettered Rage, you cannot do so again until you have reached full health, and you have long rested.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Blood of Murid</h2>
              <p>Slightly larger than even those of the Blood of Abartach, the Murid are known for their battlefield poise, ingenuity, and leading their allies to victory. With their 'First in Last out' mentality, many a Murid has turned the fate of a battle through sheer force of will.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Commanding Shout.</strong> You unleash your combat prowess on those around you, emboldening your allies and terrifying your enemies. Each ally within 30 ft. that can hear you gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma + Proficiency Bonus, and each enemy must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your CHA modifier + your PB) or run in terror until the end of their next turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Savvy Combatant.</strong> You have proficiency in improvised weapons, when you hit a creature with a ranged attack using an improvised weapon you deal damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier + twice your proficiency bonus. Your range for these attacks is 30/60.</li>
                </ul>
