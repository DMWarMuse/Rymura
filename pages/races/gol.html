          Soul's bound to the earth, a code of honor as bendable as rock, and a deep love for their ancestors - There are no better friends to have than dwarves.  They say a Dwarf never forgets a debt, to do so would shame
        not only themselves, but their family, clan, and ancestors.
        <br><br><i>"I always found it entertaining to invite the Harthorngarian and Drome representatives over for a fancy dinner, the constant compliments to each others clans, and toasts to the others ancestor is highly amusing when you know that, deep down, each think's their Line is superior to the other, but their honor will not let them voice it aloud"</i> - Baron Delmont, Green Cap Historians</p>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Blood of Abartach</h2>
              <!--<p>Drome was a warrior of great renown during the reign of the First King. After the establishment of the Kurtzigel Accords, he led his clan high into the Silver Wreath mountains, displacing the goblins and elves in that area. The clan, carving directly into the rockface of the mountains, created a secure defensible home from which they have prospered. Supplied by their highland farms, the Line of Drome has securely held their idyllic vale for over 2000 years.<br><br>Rooted in deep traditions, the children of Drome undergo thorough training to better defend their homes, and warriors of Drome are held in high esteem. Semi-isolationists, the trust of these dwarves is hard to gain; but they make steadfast friends.<br><br>Clan Drome is currently ruled by Berenia, the sixth daughter.</p>
               --> <ul>
                  <li><strong>Hidden Step.</strong> As a reaction to taking damage, you can magically turn invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Caretaker.</strong> You have the ability to communicate, in a limited manner, with plants and vegetation. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You may communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Blood of Murid</h2>
              <!-- <p>Harthorn, known as the first builder, pioneered many advancements in dwarven engineering. His teachings during the Age of Legends catapulted his clan into becoming the best miners in Rymura. They pride themselves on their mining, crafting, and building skills relative to other dwarves who they view as stagnant and old fashion.<br><br>Harthorngarian communities normally consist of 10-20 above ground buildings, the rest of their cities are accessible by cleverly designed lifts that will drop you down to the entrance of their massive Thaigs.<br><br>Known to the other races as 'The Diggers', Harthorngarians get along well with their neighbors: They have built temples to Byron, the human saint of artistry, in their towns where both humans and dwarves are known to worship, and they even boast cordial relation with the Tel'Na'Gren. They also assist neighboring kingdoms, for a fee, in scouting and marking mining locations for marble, silver, and other precious deposits.<br><br>Led by their merchant council, Clan Harthorn practices 'General Apprenticeships': Dwarves from age 20-40 are expected to apprentice at a wide variety of crafts before, at the Age of Choosing, they select a profession that suits them. Because most Harthorngarians have developed rudimentary skills in many crafts, communities quickly recover from crises like fires or raids. While warriors are not disdained and war heroes are still honored, most young dwarves of Clan Harthorn aspire to be builders.</p>
               --> <ul>
                  <li><strong>Heavy Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with weapons that have the 'Heavy' property.</li>
                  <li><strong>Damage Dealer.</strong> When you roll a 1 on a damage die for a melee attack, you can reroll the die and use the new roll. Youi can do so no more than once per turn.</li>
