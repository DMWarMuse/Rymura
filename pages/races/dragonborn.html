      <h1>Dragonborn of Rymura</h1>
        <p>The name "Dragonborn" is actually an inside joke and misnomer by the originator of the race: Melvina of the Red Coat.<br><br>
          Melvina, a mad inventor and mostly self-taught magician, was abducted from her home as a child by Mother Gothel, a Bheur Hag in the region. Gothel raised Melvina until she was a young teen when she was eventually rescued and returned to her village. Although she appeared to recover from her time living with the hag, Melvina never took off the long red coat that was gifted to her by Gothel.<br><br>
          Later in her life Melvina became a recluse; her mannerisms, magics, and tinkering’s causing her to be shunned from society. Her greatest achievement was combining drake, wyvern, and lizardfolk eggs to create her first hybrid: an intelligent bipedal race capable of producing offspring which she dubbed "Dragonborn".<br><br>
          Today, Dragonborn are very rare and prefer to live in tight communities away from major population centers, but at the height of her power Melvina was served by a host which were broken into numerous ‘Dragonflights’ that consisted of hundreds of the creatures or more.<br><br>
          Due to their above average statue, and that most think they come from the dragons of old, the few that there are in cities can often be seen as guests of influential houses, or acting as tutors, sword masters, or highly placed servants.<br><br>
          All Dragonborn share the following racial traits:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Dragonborn mature around age 30, and live to be around 150 years old.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Drake Scales.</strong> While you aren't wearing armor, you can calculate your AC as 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</li>
            <li><strong>Lizardfolk Adaptability.</strong> Dragonborn inherit the adaptability and resilience of Lizardfolk, granting them advantage on stealth rolls to hide or remain hidden, and saving throws to resist environmental hazards, toxins, and disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Wyvern Agility.</strong> Inheriting the reflexes and agility of wyverns, Dragonborn gain advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws to avoid traps, spells, and other effects that require quick reactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Claws.</strong> Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. In addition, you deal certain effects based on your Melvinian Spark determined by your Subrace.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Chromatic</h2>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Spark.</strong> On a successful hit, the focus of your attack must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your PB). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Subrace. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (3d6), 10th level (4d6), and 16th level (5d6). You can use your Melvinian Spark a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Resistance.</strong> You gain resistance from the damage type associated with your Subrace.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Metallic</h2>
            <p><strong>Brass.</strong> - Sleep (Con). <strong>Bronze</strong> - Fear (Wis). <strong>Copper</strong> - Slow (Con). <strong>Gold</strong> - Weakening (Con). <strong>Silver</strong> - Paralyze (Wis).</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Spark.</strong> On a successful hit, the focus of your attack must make the relevant saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your PB). On a failed save, the creature suffers the corresponding condition for 1 minute, during which they can attempt to save at the end of their turn. You can use your Melvinian Spark a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Resistance.</strong> You gain advantage on saving throws whos effect match your subrace.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Gemstone</h2>
            <p><strong>Amethyst</strong> - Dazed (Int). <strong>Emerald.</strong> - Restrain (Cha). <strong>Ruby</strong> - Bane (Int). <strong>Sapphire</strong> - Charm (Wis). <strong>Topaz</strong> - Blind (Con).</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Spark.</strong> On a successful hit, the focus of your attack must make the relevant saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your PB). On a failed save, the creature suffers the corresponding condition for 1 minute, during which they can attempt to save at the end of their turn. You can use your Melvinian Spark a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Melvinian Resistance.</strong> You gain resistance to psychic damage.</li>
                </ul>
