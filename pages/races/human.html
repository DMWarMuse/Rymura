          <i>"Wary be those who pull the eye of the Empire, for when that beast awakens: the mountains shake."</i> - Seargent Two-Winds, Last Stand of the Third Irregulars: Tarwins Gap - 653 SED.<br><br>
          Vigilance, Dedication, and Passion, these are the halmarks of the elven race. More reclusive than in the age of the First Empire, Tel'Na'Gren and Tarcian elves can still be found wandering the world of Man.<br><br>
        <i>"That the elves are a fractured race is a surprise to no one. Once the undisputed rulers of the known world, now spectres and shades perferring to hide in the forests and jungles to the point where seeing two together in any human city has becomes an oddity."</i> - Baron Delmont, Green Cap Historians</p>
