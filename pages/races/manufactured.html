          Soul's bound to the earth, a code of honor as bendable as rock, and a deep love for their ancestors - There are no better friends to have than dwarves.  They say a Dwarf never forgets a debt, to do so would shame
        not only themselves, but their family, clan, and ancestors.
        <br><br><i>"I always found it entertaining to invite the Harthorngarian and Drome representatives over for a fancy dinner, the constant compliments to each others clans, and toasts to the others ancestor is highly amusing when you know that, deep down, each think's their Line is superior to the other, but their honor will not let them voice it aloud"</i> - Baron Delmont, Green Cap Historians</p>

      <h1>Manufactured of Rymura</h1>
        <p>All Manufactured beings share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Manufactured creatures are considered mature upon creation and do not age in the traditional sense. They can exist indefinitely unless destroyed, but can go dormant for long periods of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Depending on their construction, Manufactured creatures can vary in size from Small to Large, but most are Medium-sized.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet if small, 30 if medium, and 35 if large.</li>
            <li><strong>Constructed Nature.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, diseased, and exhausted.</li>
            <li><strong>Durable Build.</strong> You have proficiency in Constitution saving throws. Your HP increases by 3 at level 1, and +1 each level after.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>The Heart Guard</h2>
              <p>Souls were bound to Manufactured Constructs that were created during the First War of Extermination by the Gnomes to serve as the Unbreakable Heart Guard, the elite fighting force of their army.<br><br>
                Nearly all Heart Guard were thought to be destroyed by the elves by the conclusion of the war. However, in 336 SED, a Heart Guard was found wandering the woods near the Dwarven settlement of Karsk.
                This Heart Guard had obtained a modicum of sentience and was serving as the woodlands protector, following no known instructions from its creators. The creature was destroyed, and the bound soul released.<br><br>
              The Heart Guard are creatures of artificial creation, a soul is bound to the construct giving it sentience. These creatures can be made from various materials such as metal, flora, or stone.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>All.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Optimized Subroutines.</strong> You do not sleep. Instead, you enter a state of hibernation, remaining semi-conscious but unable to see or speak, for 4 hours a day. After hibernating in this way, you gain the benefit of a long rest.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br><li><strong>Metal Heart Guard.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conductive Nature.</strong> You can absorb and channel electricity. You have advantage on saving throws against lightning damage and can use your reaction to absorb 1d8 incoming lightning damage, storing it for your next melee attack to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic Manipulation.</strong> You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to pull or shove a creature, or object, made of metal or wearing metal armor. You can attempt to pull or shove a creature or object from up to 15 feet away, pulling or shoving them 10 feet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metallic Nature.</strong> You are immune to poison damage.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br><li><strong>Stone/Earth Heart Guard.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rocky Endurance.</strong> When you take damage, you can use your Reaction to roll 1d8 + your Con modifier and reduce the damage by that total. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earthquake Stomp.</strong> Once per Long Rest as an Action, you stomp the ground causing tremors in a 15 foot radius around you. This area counts as difficult terrain and any creatures in the radius need to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your PB). On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stones Nature</strong> You are immune to poison damage.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br><li><strong>Flora Heart Guard.</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Photosynthetic Regeneration.</strong> During a Short or Long rest in direct sunlight or natural moonlight, you can regain hit points equal to your Level + Con modifier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entangling Vines.</strong> Once per Long Rest as an Action, you induce rapid growth in the surrounding plant life which being to writhe and attempt to restrain any creature within 20 feet of you. The area becomes difficult terrain and any creature within range must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your PB). On a failed save, the creature is restrained. Any creature restrained in this method can attempt a Strength save to break out of the plant life at the end of their turn. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until you move, or until you use a free action to dismiss it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verdant Nature</strong> You are immune to poison damage.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
