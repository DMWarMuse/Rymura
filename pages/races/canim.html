      <h1>Canim of Rymura</h1>
        <p>The Canim nation, which resides far to the west of Rymura's shores, makes no apologies for their views of their neighbors, secure in the belief that theirs is the superior way of life.<br><br>
          The Canim have ambassadors in many major human cities and Dwarven thaigs, there is also one in Solterris, but they are far from friendly. Their boisterous, and often repeated, claim that they will eventually invade Rymura's shores has dictated that each ambassador can only have 4 servants at a time. To the best knowledge there are no Canim on Rymura who are not part of an ambassador's envoy. All Canim on Rymura report to Ambassador Targa located in Wilket.<br><br>
          Only trained, or well guarded, officials will meet with the Canim: A wrong remark to a Canim envoy has been known to result in ripped off limbs or outright death. Canim look like Lupine version of Gnolls, but larger and more capable. Mistaking a Canim for a Gnoll is a great way to earn an early death.<br><br>
          Greatly emphasizing personal, family, and clan honor, the Canim's society is split into 3 castes; makers, warriors, and priests. The foremost charge of the warrior and priest caste is to serve the makers. While they have the least power, makers are by far the most numerous.<br><br>
          All Canim share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Canim are considered mature at the age of 12, and have similar lifespans to Humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Larger than Humans and Elves, your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
            <li><strong>Hunters Bite.</strong> Your powerful jaw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Intimidating Visage.</strong> Not native to the continent, your appearance set's others on edge. You are proficient in Intimidation, and you have advantage on Intimidation rolls against other non-canim.</li>
            <li><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</li>
            <li><strong>Leap.</strong> Your base long jump and high jump distance is multiplied by 2.</li>
            <li><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Canish, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>
