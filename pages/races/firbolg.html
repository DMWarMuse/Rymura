      <h1>Firbolg of Rymura</h1>
        <p>Thought to have been created by Salix, the first God, the Firbolg are by far the oldest race on Rymura.<br><br>
          Firbolg live a secluded life in hidden dwellings deep in the most untamed parts of the wilderness. Active Firbolg enclaves are very difficult to find, as they use magic and nature itself to keep them hidden. Most interestingly is that the abandoned Firbolg enclaves that explorers have been able to find always coincide with a Godblind.<br><br>
          All Firbolg share the following racial traits:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Firbolg mature at around 80-100 years of age, they generally live around 1000 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
            <li><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Firbolg, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Preserver</h2>
              <p>These Firbolg tend the surrounding wilds and ensure that nature will thrive. Generally docile, the Preserver's worship Salix, also holding a lesser reverence for Einhasad.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Hidden Step.</strong> As a reaction to taking damage, you can magically turn invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Caretaker.</strong> You have the ability to communicate, in a limited manner, with plants and vegetation. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You may communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dubh Catha's</h2>
              <p>The defining moment that drove this sect to abandon Salix for the power of the Shadowfell, and spark the burning disdain for their preserver cousins, is unknown. However, these firbolg are extremely warlike, and seem to exist for nothing more than fighting, pain, and serving their master Dubh Catha, and his chosen: the Firbolg-Darkling hybrid Jaggerjack.</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li><strong>Heavy Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with weapons that have the 'Heavy' property.</li>
                  <li><strong>Damage Dealer.</strong> When you roll a 1 on a damage die for a melee attack, you can reroll the die and use the new roll. You can do so no more than once per turn.</li>
                </ul>
