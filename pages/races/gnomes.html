      <h1>Gnomes of Rymura</h1>
        <p>Gnomes are a dying breed desperately searching for a way to unify their dwindling numbers. Fiercely loyal to their elders, the Gnomes have branched into two distinct paths: The House of Mot who work to return the Gnomes to a position of influence, and the House of Callurdan who began anew deep underground after fleeing the atrocities of the First War of Extermination.</p>

        <p>All Gnomes share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and most are expected to settle ito adult life around the age of 40. They can live 350 years on average, but it's not too uncommon for them to reach 500 years of age.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Small.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Fortified Mind.</strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic, advantage on Concentration checks, and you are resistant to Psychic damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>House of Mot</h2>
              <p>Those of the House of Mot are loyal to their race above all but, having historically been on the same side during most major conflicts, also have close ties to the Hin and Dwarves. Most Gnomes follow the edicts of the Last House (House of Garl) set down before the First War of Extermination decimated the Gnomish population, and then carried on by House Mot.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Gnomish Intuition.</strong> You gain proficiency in History and Investigation.
                      <ul>
                        <li>You gain advantage on History checks related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices.</li>
                        <li>You gain advantage to Investigation checks made to detect traps, secret doors, or hidden items</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Tinker.</strong> You have proficiency with, and gain a set of, Tinkerâ€™s Tools. While using these tools, you can add a d8 to any roll made to fix, or break, mechanical devices (Portcullises, Automatons, Ballista, Mills, etc.).
                      <ul>
                        <li>Also Using these tools, you can spend 1 hour to construct a Tiny clockwork device. The device ceases to function after 48 hours unless you spend 1 hour repairing it or use your action to dismantle it. You can have a number of devices active at one time equal to your Proficiency Bonus. When you create a device, use the following options as a guide:</li>
                        <li><strong>Clockwork Toy:</strong> When placed on the ground, the toy can move 5 feet across the ground, or do a flip, on each of your turns, and makes appropriate noises.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fire Starter:</strong> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire.</li>
                        <li><strong>Music Box:</strong> When opened, this music box plays a single song.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other:</strong> At your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these. The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such devices.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>House of Callurdan</h2>
              <p>The House of Callurdan, driven deep underground during of the First War of Extermination, decided to stay in the World Below and abandon the Blood of the Golden Hills. Though the House of Mot looks down on the Callurdan claiming they have abandoned their true heritage, the Callurdan hold no ill intent towards House Mot.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                  <li><strong>Natural Illusionist.</strong> You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Wards and Seals.</strong> Using the resonance in gemstones, you can cast the Alarm spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the Arcane Lock spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells, requires a gemstone of your choice as the material component (gem acts as the key to the Arcane Lock).</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Gnomeling</h2>
              <p>The pairing of a Gnome and a Hin are rare but highly celebrated as they bring closer ties between both peoples who have, historically, been allies during most conflicts. While the same size as other Gnome, they tend to have more youthful facial features. Gnomelings are equally accepted in both Hin and Gnome communities.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Age.</strong> While Gnomelings mature much earlier than full blooded Gnomes, they tend to live shorter lives with few exceeding three centuries.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hin Heritage.</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Naturally Nimble.</strong> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</li>
                      <li><strong>Brave.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
                      <li><strong>Language.</strong> You also speak, read, and write Hin.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
