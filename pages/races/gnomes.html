          Gnomes are a dying breed desperately searchingfor a way to unify their dwindling numbers. Fiercely loyal to their elders, the Gnomes have branched into two distinct paths: The House of Mot who work secretly to return the Gnomes to a position of influence, and th House of Callurdan who began anew deep undergroundafter fleeing the atrocities of the First War of Extermination.</p>

      <h1>Gnomes of Rymura</h1>
        <p>All Gnomes share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and most are expected to settle ito adult life around the age of 40. They can live 350 years on average, but it's not too uncommon for them to reach 500 years of age.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall. Your size is Small.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>House of Mot</h2>
              <p>Gnomes are loyal to family, clan, and race. Most Gnomes follow the edicts of the Last House (House of Garl) before the FWoE decimated the Gnomish population.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Artificer's Lore.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tinker.</strong> You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</li>
                  <ul><li><strong>Clockwork Toy:</strong> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire Starter:</strong> The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Music Box:</strong> When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other:</strong> At your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such effects.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
            <h2>House of Callurdan</h2>
              <p>These Gnomes, driven deep underground because of the FWoE, decided to stay in the World Below and abandon the blood of the golden hills. Though the House of Mot looks down on he Callurdan claiming they long ago abandoned their true heritage, the Callurdan hold no ill intent towards House Mot.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                  <li><strong>Natural Illusionist.</strong> You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Wards and Seals.</strong> Using the innate magical resonance in gemstones, you can cast the Alarm spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the Arcane Lock spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, yu can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells, requires a gemstone of your choice as the material component.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Gnomeling</h2>
              <p>The pairing of a hin and a gnome is rare, but they are celebrated and bring closer ties between the halfling and gnome who have, historically, been allies during most conflicts.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Small Beast Affinity.</strong> Through sound and gestures, you may communicate simple ideas with Small or Smaller beasts.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lucky.</strong> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is a 1.</li>
                  <li><strong>Brave.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
                  <li><strong>Language.</strong> You also speak, read and write Hin (Halfling).</li>
                </ul>
