      <h1>Orc of Rymura</h1>
        <p>All Orc share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Lesser Orcs are considered mature enough to fight around age 10 and, because of their constant waring, live an average of 45 years. Half-Orcs and Greater Orcs are considered mature around 15, and live the same lifespans as humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Relentless Endurance.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Orcish, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Greater Orcs</h2>
              <p>"Greater" Orcs are those who have rejected the blood of the Orcish pantheon and what it represents. They have embraced trade and cordial relations with their neighbors, but their settlements are normally found on the outskirts of civilization: far enough away to give comfort, but close enough for relations. Most Greater Orcs worship Dicium and Saint Vora the Harbinger.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Adrenaline Rush.</strong> As a bonus action, you can move up half your speed toward a hostile creature that it can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Whenever you use this trait, then take the attack action, you can double your proficiency bonus for the attack(s).</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Lesser Orcs</h2>
              <p>Blood, death, and destruction: The gods must be entertained. Lesser Orcs believe they exist to keep the Orcish gods jovial, and nothing makes them happier then fighting, misery, and carnage; especially if committed against the non-believing races. No one, even the Orcs, want to see the great gods Gruumsh, Luthic, or Ilneval unentertained. They constantly work towards creating avatars so the gods can join their depraved fray. The Lesser Orcs are not friendly towards humans, and rarely friendly between their own clans.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Savage Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can perform one additional attack.</li>
                  <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Half Orcs</h2>
              <p>Offspring between Humans and Orcs, while viable, rarely ever happen. If this bearing is brought to term the child will be stuck between worlds: Too human to be accepted into the Orc world. The Greater Orcs will at least keep the child until the end of adolescence, while teaching them to fight and survive, before turning them out into the world. Born to the Lesser Orcs, and not killed outright, the child will be left out to the elements to live or die as the gods will. Born into a human village they will, usually, be ostracized and feared, most will avoid being in public if possible.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> In addition to the ASI you get from your Orc heritage, you can choose one additional ability score to increase by 1 (cannot be the same as the ones you already chose).</li>
                  <li><strong>Feat.</strong> You gain one Feat of your choice.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gifted.</strong> Choose one option:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ingenious.</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Learner.</strong> Gain one tool proficiency from Artisan Tools, Healing Kit, Herbalism Kit, Water or Land Vehicles, and one Armor or Weapon proficiency of your choice.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
