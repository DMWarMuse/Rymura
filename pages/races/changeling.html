      <h1>Changeling of Rymura</h1>
        <p>Changelings are humanoid amalgams, constructs, created by using dark arts and an infant child. Due to the despicable nature of the profane act of creating a Changeling, the practice is outlawed, and rumors are actively hunted by followers of St. Moraine the Purifier.<br><br>
          Most Changelings were created by the wizard Achulous, called The Mad, while he was advisor to the last king of Kyore. Now nearly extinct, those Changelings that have not been hunted down are kept in secret by powerful families and societies. Their ability to sense the emotions of those around them make them skilled agents and spies.<br><br>
          Due to their adaptive physiology and self-healing ability, Changelings can survive in extreme temperatures and harsh environments where other races can not.<br><br>
          All Changeling share the following racial traits:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Changelings are created fully mature from profane acts condemned by all but the blackest gods. The lifespans of a changeling coincide directly to the quality of 'ingredients' used in their creation.  As most Changelings have been hunted, or have otherwise died out, Changelings found today are either very young, or very old.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size, between small and large, reflects your current form.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed depends on your current form.</li>
            <li><strong>Changeling.</strong> As part of a successful Full Rest (72 hours) you can change your appearance and your voice. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, and can change your size between Large, Medium, and Small, though none of your game statistics change, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use this feature to change into another form, or until you die.</li>
            <li><strong>Control of Form.</strong> You have advantage against any spell or effect that would alter your form.</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicitous Instincts.</strong> You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Healing.</strong> Directly after taking damage you can use your Reaction to close some of your wounds, healing for 1d6 damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Sense Emotion.</strong> As an action you can focus your senses on one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. You instantly learn the target’s prevailing emotion, whether it’s love, anger, pain, fear, calm, or something else. If the target isn’t actually humanoid or it is immune to being charmed, you sense that it is calm.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages.</li>
          </ul>
