            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Aphosian</h2>
              <p>The Aphosian are a small clan of elves that have been inhabiting the Chokewood on the island of Aphos since they were exiled by the other elven clans in what was known as "The Time of the Mad Ones Rage". Wilder and less refined than their mainland cousins, Aphosians worship their god Ithmir, Minor Exarch of Asgorath, and have instituted a strict policy of population control to ensure they do not grow beyond the borders of the Chokewood. Aphosians are extermely territorial and do not suffer intruders into their forest. Clan Aphos is shunned by the other elves.</p>

            <h2>Holdanaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloqially as the Tel'Na'Gren, Clan Holdanaithe is the most tradition bound of the elven clans. Inhabiting their ancestreal home of Tel'Na'Gra, the Holdanaithe number the most lorekeepers and spellweavers of any clan. Though they acknowledge the importance of Sylinus, the Great Satyr, the Holdanaithe have greater reverance for Neltelentol, The Great Dryad.</p>

                </ul>

            <h2>Holmnaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloquially as the Tarcian Empire, Clan Holmnaithe resides in the junlges of Tarc where they inhabit they three great stone cities: Tel'Noctis, Tel'??????, and Tel'??????. The Holmnaithe fought the fiercest and the longest after the Second War of Extermination and subsequent end of the First Empire. While they have a small number of lorekeepers, and even fewer spellweavers, Clan Holmnaithe has a great number of warriors. Though they acknowledge the importance of Neltelentol, the Great Dryad, the Holmnaithe have greater reverance for Sylinus, the Great Stayr protector. Those warriors who have earned distinction decorate their armor with Saytr horns.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Artisan Expertise.</strong> You gain proficiency with two kinds of artisan's tools of your choice. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Myrknaithe</h2>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Strike Leader Gronbach felt, much like the elves, that they should invade and subjugate (or eliminate) their neighbors before they become a problem. Unlike the unified elves, Gronbauch didn't have the backing of his leaders and was exiled from the Dwarven lands. Gronbach led many like-minded dwarves deep underground, eventually establishing a hold and clan. There, deep in their underground fortresses, the Line of Gronbauch plot their revenge against their cousins in the world above. So far, their plotted revenge has not materialized as they constantly struggle against the other denizens of the world below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray..</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Setnael</h2>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Clan Setnael advocated for the subjagation of all the "lower race" who inhabited Rymura. At the time the Empire didn't agree with the harsh rehtoric of the Setnael which caused a schism. Clan Setnael voluntairly left the elven fold and retreated deep in the unhabited recesses of Rymura where they cut off communication to the First empire, eventually they would leave the prime material plane altogether, instead opting for the world below and the plane of the new power they had taken to worship: The Shadowfell and the Raven Queen.<br><br>
              Small numbers of the Setnael have been seen throughout the ages on Rymura working towards unknown ends and warring with Dubh Catha's Firbolgs. Colloqually these elves are know as the "Lost Ones" or the "Deep Ones".</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray..</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Villtur</h2>
              <p>Clan Villtur has changed to such a degree since the time of the First Empire, that most of the other races do not even know that they were once eleves. When Clan Setnael broke off from the Empire, the charge of watching over and managing the other races was left to the Villtur. The building animosity from the Gnomes, Dwarves, and Hin leading up to the First War of Extermination saw many Villtur patrols ambushed by Well-kitted Hin.<br><br>...<br><br> The atrocities commited by the Villtur pushed them from the then viloent warmongers to the corrupt ones we know today, though they began the worship of their dark god at a later date. Most of the battles as the end of the FWoE were between the Holdnathe and Holmnatihe as they attempted to end the killing of Gnomes and Halflings by the Villtur for a war that was cleary over and won.  After this the Villtur never returend to the first empire and are today known by a different name: Hobgoblins.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
