            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <p>Listed by chronological breaks from the First Empire.</p>

            <h2>Aphosian</h2>
              <p>The Aphosian are a small clan of elves that have inhabited the Chokewood on the island of Aphos since they were exiled by the other elven clans of the First Empire in what was known as "The Time of the Mad Ones Rage" during the First Elven Dominance.<br><br>Wilder and less refined than their mainland cousins, Aphosians worship their god Ithmir, Minor Exarch of Asgorath, and have instituted a strict policy of population control to ensure they do not grow beyond the borders of the Chokewood. Aphosians are extermely territorial and do not suffer intruders into their forest.<br><br>Clan Aphos is shunned by the other elven clans.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</li>
                  <li><strong>Armor Training.</strong> You have proficiency in all armors.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Setnael</h2>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Clan Setnael, whom were charged with the monitoring of other burgeoning races, began to advocated for the culling of what they would argue before the Council as "Future Enemies". The Empire didn't agree with the harsh rehtoric of the Setnael, so the Clan took it upon itself to safe guard the future of the elves.<br><br>When reports began to reach the Council of the numerous burned out villages and bodies left to rot on the plains, Clan Villtur, who numbered the highest amount of warriors, was sen to reign them in.  Though Clan Setnael was eventually stopped, officially castigated, and exiled from the Empire, they had already set into motion the events that would eventually lead into the First Elven War of Extermination.<br><br>Clan Setnael left the elven fold and retreated deep in the unhabited recesses of Rymura, eventually leaving the prime material plane altogether, opting for the World Below and with it the new power they had began to worship: The Shadowfell and the Raven Queen.<br><br>
              Small numbers of Setnael have been seen throughout the ages on the Prime Material Plane, working towards unknown ends and often warring with the Firbolgs of Dubh Catha. Colloqually these elves are known as the "Lost Ones" or "Deep Ones".</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray..</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Villtur</h2>
              <p>The animosity bred from the actions of the Setnael caused the other races to shy away from, or clash, with the First Empire; mainly with Clan Villtur who took over the charge of watching, and managing, the "lesser" races of Rymura. This duty became increasing periluos as the Gnomes, Dwarves, and Hin forged an alliance: The ingenuity of Gnomes, paired with the production of the Dwarves, soon fielded better weapons and armor than the elves. Ambushes of well-kitted Hin began to kill entire Villtur patrols.<br><br>The voices of war grew loud in the Elven Council, non more fervent then the Villtur; within one century of the Setnael being exiled for their actions against the other races of Rymura, the First Empire would march to war. While the First Empire would decidingly win what became known as the First Elven War of Extermination, the atrocities committed by Clan Villtur would push them form the then violent warmongers, to the Corript Ones we know today, though the began the worship of their dark god at a later date Clan Villtur has changed to such a degree since the time of the First Empire that most of the other races are unaware that they were once elves.<br><br>Most of the battles at the end of the FWoE were between Villtur and Holmnaithe as Clan Holmnaithe tried to end the killing of Gnomes and Hin in a war taht was clearly over and won.<br><br>At the end of the war, Clan Villtur did not return to the lands of the Empire and are better known by a different name: Hobgoblins.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray..</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Myrknaithe</h2>
              <p>Prior to the Second War of Extermination (known by the elves as the Subjagation War), Clan Myrknaithe argued in the Council to expand the First Empire to include the other races but that all provincal control and laws be kept at the purview of the elves, this, they argued, was the best way to keep the "lesser" races under control. The Myrknaithe proposal was denied by the Council, but what the First Empire was unaware of was that the Myrknaithe has already begun their attacks and forced the remaining two clans, the Holdnaithe and Holmnaithe, into an "us or them" situation.<br><br>After their defeat and the dissolusion of the First Empire, the remaining Myrknaithe, shunned by their cousins, left for the North and now reside in the areas surrounding Mount Telvas in the Eastern Vale.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray..</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Holdnaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloqially as the Tel'Na'Gren, Clan Holdnaithe is the most tradition bound of the elven clans. After the fall for the First Empire, the Holdnaithe claimed their ancestreal home of Tel'Na'Gra for themselves. They number the most lorekeepers and spellweavers of any clan. Though they acknowledge the importance of Sylinus, the Great Satyr, the Holdnaithe have greater reverance for Neltelentol, The Great Dryad.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong> You have advanmtage on saving throws against poison, and you ahve resistance to poison damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Eyes of the Herald.</strong> Whenever you make a Perception or Investigation roll, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Holmnaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloquially as the Tarcian Empire, Clan Holmnaithe retreated to the junlges of Tarc after the fall of the First Empire where they still inhabit the three great stone cities of Tel'Noctis, Tel'??????, and Tel'Volens.<br><br>The Holmnaithe continued to fight long after the end of the Second War of Extermination, and subsequent end of the First Empire, which led to lasting strain with their neighbors well into the Second Human Dominance. The effects of this can still be seen with the Tarcian policy against allowing non-elves into their territory with the exception of Sol'Terris, the only integrated city in the Tarcian expanse.<br><br>While they have a small number of lorekeepers, and even fewer spellweavers, compared to their Tel'Na'Gren cousins; Clan Holmnaithe has a great number of warriors. Though Clan Holmnaithe acknowledges the importance of Neltelentol, the Great Dryad, the Holmnaithe have greater reverance for Sylinus, the Great Stayr protector. Those warriors who have earned distinction often decorate their armor with Saytr horns.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Artisan Expertise.</strong> You gain proficiency with two kinds of artisan's tools of your choice. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
                </ul>
