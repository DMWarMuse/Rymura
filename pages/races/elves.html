      <h1>Elves of Rymura</h1>
        <p>All Elves share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> An elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 100 and generally live to be between 1000 - 1100, with the eldest lorekeeprs reaching almost 1600.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
            <li><strong>Graceful Nature.</strong> Naturally inclined to a balanced gait, you have proficiency in Acrobatics.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Elven, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <p>Listed chronologically by breaks from the First Empire.</p>

            <h2>Aphosian</h2>
              <p>The Aphosian are a small clan of elves that have inhabited the Chokewood on the island of Aphos since they were exiled by the other elven clans of the First Empire in what was known as "The Time of the Mad Ones Rage" during the First Elven Dominance.<br><br>Wilder and less refined than their mainland cousins, Aphosians worship their god Ithmir, Minor Exarch of Asgorath, and have instituted a strict policy of population control to ensure they do not grow beyond the borders of the Chokewood. Aphosians are extremely territorial and do not suffer intruders into their forest.<br><br>Clan Aphos is shunned by the other elven clans.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Beast Affinity.</strong> ?????? <!-- Since your pairing with a beast at a young age, you have formed an everlasting bond with your companion (MCDM Beastheart Companion rules, see DM for info). --></li>
                  <li><strong>Wode Borne.</strong> ??????</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Setnael</h2>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Clan Setnael, whom were charged with the monitoring of other burgeoning races, began to advocated for the culling of what they would argue before the Council as "Future Enemies". The Empire didn't agree with the harsh rhetoric of the Setnael, so the Clan took it upon itself to safeguard the future of the elves.<br><br>When reports of the numerous burned out villages and bodies left to rot on the plains began to reach the Council, Clan Villtur, who numbered the highest amount of warriors, was sent to reign Clan Setnael in. Though they were eventually stopped, officially castigated, and exiled from the Empire, the Setnael had already set into motion the events that would lead into the First Elven War of Extermination.<br><br>Clan Setnael left the elven fold and retreated deep in the uninhabited recesses of Rymura, eventually leaving the prime material plane altogether for the new power they had begun to worship: The Shadowfell and the Raven Queen.<br><br>Small numbers of Setnael have been seen throughout the ages on the Prime Material Plane, working towards unknown ends and often warring with the Firbolgs of Dubh Catha. Colloquially these elves are known as the "Lost Ones" or "Shadowed Ones".</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Curse of the Shadowfell.</strong> See document here.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Villtur</h2>
              <p>The animosity bred from the actions of the Setnael caused the other races to shy away from, or clash, with the First Empire; mainly with Clan Villtur who took over the charge of watching, and managing, the "lesser" races of Rymura. This duty became increasing perilous as the Gnomes, Dwarves, and Hin forged an alliance: The ingenuity of Gnomes, paired with the production of the Dwarves, soon fielded better weapons and armor than the elves. Ambushes of well-kitted Hin began to kill entire Villtur patrols.<br><br>The voices of war grew loud in the Elven Council, none more fervent then the Villtur; within one century of the Setnael being exiled for their actions against the other races of Rymura, the First Empire would march to war.<br><br>While the First Empire would decisively win what became known as the First Elven War of Extermination, the atrocities committed by Clan Villtur would push them from the then violent warmongers, to the Corrupt Ones we know today. Though they began the worship of their dark god at a later date, Clan Villtur has changed to such a degree since the time of the First Empire that most of the other races are unaware that they were once elves.<br><br>Most of the battles at the end of the FWoE were between Clan Villtur and The Holmnaithe and Holdnaithe as they tried to end the killing of Gnomes and Hin in a war that was clearly over and won.<br><br>At the end of the war, Clan Villtur did not return to the lands of the Empire and are now better known by a different name: Hobgoblins.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Grievous Fury.</strong> If you are at half of your maximum health or lower (known as "bloodied") your attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Odious Visage.</strong> You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and have proficiency in Intimidation.
                  <li><strong>Willful Redress.</strong> You are careful not to show weakness in front of your allies. If you miss with an attack roll, or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Myrknaithe</h2>
              <p>Prior to the Second War of Extermination (known by the elves as the Subjugation War), Clan Myrknaithe argued in the Council to expand the First Empire to include the other races but that all provincial control and laws be kept at the purview of the elves, this, they argued, was the best way to keep the "lesser" races under control. The Myrknaithe proposal was denied by the Council, but what the First Empire was unaware of was that the Myrknaithe has already begun their attacks and forced the remaining two clans, the Holdnaithe and Holmnaithe, into an "us or them" situation.<br><br>After their defeat and the dissolution of the First Empire, the remaining Myrknaithe, shunned by their cousins, left for the North and now reside in the areas surrounding Mount Telvas, and in the World Below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Cursed Insight:</strong><ul><li>You can innately detect the presence of cursed items within 60 feet of you.</li><li>You have advantage on saves made to resist curses.</li><li>You have advantage on saves made against spells with curse-like effects (Fear, Slow, Confusion, etc.)</li></ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Survivor.</strong> You are proficient in the Survival Skill.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Holdnaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloquially as the Tel'Na'Gren, Clan Holdnaithe is the most tradition bound of the elven clans. After the fall for the First Empire, the Holdnaithe claimed their ancestral home of Tel'Na'Gra for themselves. They number the most lorekeepers and spellweavers of any clan. Though they acknowledge the importance of Sylinus, the Great Satyr, the Holdnaithe have greater reverence for Neltelentol, The Great Dryad.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Spellweaver Training:</strong><ul><li>You know the Druidcraft Cantrip.</li><li>When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Fog Cloud spell with this trait.</li></li><li>When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Warding Wind spell with this trait.</li><li>Once you cast Fog Cloud or Warding Wind with this trait, you cannot cast that spell again until you finish a long rest, Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier for these spells.</li></ul>
                  <li><strong>Cerebral Fortitude.</strong> Whenever you make a Wisdom or Intelligence Saving Throw, or an Ability Check using Arcana or History, you can add a d6 to the roll potentially turning a failure into a success.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Holmnaithe</h2>
              <p>Known colloquially as the Tarcian Empire, Clan Holmnaithe retreated to the jungles of Tarc after the fall of the First Empire where they still inhabit the three great stone cities of Tel'Noctis, Tel'??????, and Tel'Volens.<br><br>The Holmnaithe continued to fight long after the end of the Second War of Extermination, and subsequent end of the First Empire, which led to lasting strain with their neighbors well into the Second Human Dominance. The effects of this can still be seen with the Tarcian policy against allowing non-elves into their territory with the exception of Sol'Terris, the only integrated city in the Tarcian expanse.<br><br>While they have a small number of lorekeepers, and even fewer spellweavers, compared to their Tel'Na'Gren cousins; Clan Holmnaithe has a great number of warriors. Though Clan Holmnaithe acknowledges the importance of Neltelentol, the Great Dryad, the Holmnaithe have greater reverence for Sylinus, the Great Satyr protector. Those warriors who have earned distinction often decorate their armor with Satyr horns.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Tarcian Combat Training:</strong><ul><li>You are proficient with Light Armor. When wearing Light Armor and no Shield, your AC increases by 1.</li><li>You are proficient with Long bows, Short Bows, and two melee weapons of your choice. Your damage increases by 1 when using these weapons.</li></ul>
                  <li><strong>Combat Ready.</strong> Always ready for a fight, you add an additional 1d4 to your Initiative rolls. When you use your Attack Action during the first round of combat, any creature damaged by you takes an extra 1d4 force damage.</li>
                </ul>
