          <i>"I once saw a group of Halfling children gathered in a meadow at twilight. One of the children was waving a long stick in the air, and tied to the end was a large beetle attempting to fly away. As I was about to ask what they were doing, a large bat swopped down and ate the beetle, getting caught on the end of line.  Once the bat was close enough to the ground, the other children surrounded it and beat it with clubs until it lie dead.  This is when I first discovered that there is more to theses cunning creatures than first meets the eye."</i> - Baron Delmont, Green Cap Historians</p>

      <h1>Hin of Rymura</h1>
        <p>Even before their population was decimated during the First War of Extermination, the Hin were a pseudo-nomadic people. One of the defining characteristics of the Hin is the ability to pack everything they own into one overland pack (called a Rucken'mor), or a hand cart, and move around the region of their Enclave. Hin have a great ability to adapt to their surroundings: Evolutionary traits within an recently moved enclave can begin to show as early as within that same generation that made the move.<br><br>Not ones for centeralized governments, most enclaves are "ruled" by a merchant council or council of elders. In practice these councils are only there to settle the most dire of disputes and do not persue, or want, this power. Hin favor Communal Parity and agricultural idealism; To a Hin, regardless of job or standing, one life is worth the same as any other and they more concerned with family and feasts. Even Hin festivals are more about the changing seasons and less about any Gods.<br><br>All Halfling share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the the middle of his or her second century.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Small.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Brave.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
            <li><strong>Naturally Nimble.</strong> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Hin, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Blackbriar</h2>
              <p>The Blackbriar Enclave have lived in their namesake forest for generations and have learned to communicate with the small nature spirits that inhabit such areas.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Children of the Woods.</strong><ul><li>You know the Druidcraft Cantrip.</li><li>At 3rd level, you can cast the Entangle spell once per long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</li><li>You can move through difficult terrain made of non-magical plants and overgrowth without expending extra movement. Checks made to track you in this environment are rolled with disadvantage.</li></ul>
                  <li><strong>Kindred Soul.</strong> Within a forest, woods, or copse of trees, you can attempt to summon, and communicate with, a forest or woodland sprite.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dauntless</h2>
              <p>Hailing from their high mountain homes, the Dauntless Enclave has a higher fortitude than their lowland cousins.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Stout Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to cold and poison damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sturdy.</strong> When you fail a Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add it to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Lightfeet</h2>
              <p>Your Enclave hails from the outskirts of the Plains of Torment. Generations of living next to, and hiding from, the vicious predators of the plains has given your people a new otherworldly propensity in the area of stealth.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Naturally Stealthy.</strong><ul><li>You gain proficiency with the Stealth skill.</li><li>You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural like phenomena.</li><li>Ability checks made to track you are made with disadvantage.</li></ul></li>
                  <li><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Gnomeling</h2>
              <p>The offspring of a Gnome and a Hin are rarer than Teeque's, but highly celebrated as they bring closer ties between both peoples who have, historically, been allies during most conflicts. While the same size as other Hin, they tend to have more mature facial features. Gnomelings are equally accepted in both Hin and Gnome communities.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Age.</strong> Gnomelings age similar to other Halflings, but on average live a century longer.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gnomish Heritage.</strong>
                    <ul><strong> Fortified Mind.</strong> You have advantage on all intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves against magic.</li></ul>
                  </li>                
                </ul>

            <h2>Teeque</h2>
              <p>Offspring of a Human and a Hin. The ones inclined to a halfling lifestyle are treasured because of their (relative) power and height, they make great lamp lighters.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Age.</strong> While they mature at the same rate as full blooded Hin, Teeque's tend to live shorter lives with few exceeding two centuries.</li>
                  <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
                  <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                  <li><strong>Human Heritage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> In addition to the ASI you get from your Hin heritage, you can choose two ability scores and increase them by 1 (The ability scores cannot be the same as the ones you already chose)</li>
                      <li><strong>Ingenious (Replaces Naturally Nimble).</strong> Gain one tool proficiency of your choice from Artisan Tools, Healers Kit, Herbalism Kit, Water or Land Vehicles, and one Armor or Weapon proficieny of your choice.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
