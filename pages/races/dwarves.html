        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0px;">
          Soul's bound to the earth, a code of honor as bendable as rock, and a deep love for their ancestors - There are no better friends to have than dwarves.  They say a Dwarf never forgets a debt, to do so would shame
        not only themselves, but their family, clan, and ancestors.
        <br><br><i>"I always found it entertaining to invite the Harthorngarian and Drome representatives over for a fancy dinner, the constant compliments to each others clans, and toasts to the others ancestor is highly amusing when you know that, deep down, each think's their Line is superior to the other, but their honor will not let them voice it aloud"</i> - Baron Delmont, Green Cap Historians</p>

      <h1>Dwarves of Rymura</h1>
        <p>All Dwarves share the following racial traits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Dwarves, barring external factors such as wars and famine, can live between 400 - 500 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Generations of living under the earth has given you superior vision. You see in dim light within 60 feet of you, dimming at 30 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
            <li><strong>Tethered Soul.</strong> Your very essence is rooted deeply to the earth which allows you to better withstand certain magics: You are resistant to Cold, Fire, and Lightning damage caused by magical effects. You also have advantage on Saving Throws made to unwillingly transport you to a different plane of existence.</li>
            <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Dwarven, and one other language.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h2>Line of Drome</h2>
              <p>Drome was a warrior of great renown during the reign of the First King. After the establishment of the Kurtzigel Accords, he led his clan high into the Silver Wreath mountains, displacing the goblins and elves in that area. The clan, carving directly into the rockface of the mountains, created a secure defensible home from which they have prospered. Supplied by their highland farms, the Line of Drome has securely held their idyllic vale for over 2000 years.<br><br>Rooted in deep traditions, the children of Drome undergo thorough training to better defend their homes, and warriors of Drome are held in high esteem. Semi-isolationists, the trust of these dwarves is hard to gain; but they make steadfast friends.<br><br>Clan Drome is currently ruled by Berenia, the sixth daughter.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 5, and it increases by 2 every time you gain a level.</li>
                  <li><strong>Armor Training.</strong> You have proficiency in all armors.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Line of Harthorn</h2>
              <p>Harthorn, known as the first builder, pioneered many advancements in dwarven engineering. His teachings during the Age of Legends catapulted his clan into becoming the best miners in Rymura. They pride themselves on their mining, crafting, and building skills relative to other dwarves who they view as stagnant and old fashion.<br><br>Harthorngarian communities normally consist of 10-20 above ground buildings, the rest of their cities are accessible by cleverly designed lifts that will drop you down to the entrance of their massive Thaigs.<br><br>Known to the other races as 'The Diggers', Harthorngarians get along well with their neighbors: They have built temples to Byron, the human saint of artistry, in their towns where both humans and dwarves are known to worship, and they even boast cordial relation with the Tel'Na'Gren. They also assist neighboring kingdoms, for a fee, in scouting and marking mining locations for marble, silver, and other precious deposits.<br><br>Led by their merchant council, Clan Harthorn practices 'General Apprenticeships': Dwarves from age 20-40 are expected to apprentice at a wide variety of crafts before, at the Age of Choosing, they select a profession that suits them. Because most Harthorngarians have developed rudimentary skills in many crafts, communities quickly recover from crises like fires or raids. While warriors are not disdained and war heroes are still honored, most young dwarves of Clan Harthorn aspire to be builders.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Artisan Expertise.</strong> You gain proficiency with two kinds of artisan's tools of your choice. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Endurance.</strong> You are able to push yourself onward where others would collapse, you regain 1 Hit Die at the end of a Short Rest.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Line of Frost</h2>
              <p>Prior to the dissolution of the Kurtzigel Accords, Frost, Thane of the Desolate Reaches, led his warband north on the rumor of a Gremorian incursion. They never returned. Generations later, after the Second War of Extermination, a band of dwarves arrived in the Free cities of Tarwin seeking to establish trade. They introduced themselves as the Line of Frost.<br><br>The Line of Frost tends towards fierce isolationism and calls the frozen tundra of the Far Reaches home. Their communities are much smaller and more spread out compared to other dwarves. They have frequently clashed with the Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Elves of the Winter Forests in the Eastern Vale.<br><br>Their infrequent visits to the Free Cities of Tarwin seem to coincide with winter blizzards, but it is not known if the blizzards herald the coming of these dwarves, or if it is the blizzards that follow them.<br><br>The Line of Frost is currently under rule of Helced, the 16th Son.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on constitution saving throws, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Marching Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Line of Gronbauch</h2>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Strike Leader Gronbach felt, much like the elves, that they should invade and subjugate (or eliminate) their neighbors before they become a problem. Unlike the unified elves, Gronbauch didn't have the backing of his leaders and was exiled from the Dwarven lands. Gronbach led many like-minded dwarves deep underground, eventually establishing a hold and clan. There, deep in their underground fortresses, the Line of Gronbauch plot their revenge against their cousins in the world above. So far, their plotted revenge has not materialized as they constantly struggle against the other denizens of the World Below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Psionic Fortitude.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed, dazed, or stunned condition on yourself, you also have resistance to Psychic damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> The World Below is a dark place. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you, dimming at 60 feet, as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                </ul>

Any dwarven family became free to set up and establish their own household outside the lands of Drumindore, any who stay would swear fealty to a regent selected by the late kings advisors. Any aggression towards other dwarven households would result in genocide at the hands of the regents army for the aggressor.</p>
