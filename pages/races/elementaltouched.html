      <h1>Elemental Touched</h1>
        <p>Elemental Touched beings have been blessed, or cursed, by powerful beings of the elemental plane. The physical changes can vary from slight to noticeable: An Earth Touched Dwarf may have shale like protrusions on their face or arms, or a Flame Touched Elf could have brilliant red hair. Depending on who you interact with this can be seen as a blessing, a curse, or nothing more than a harmless oddity.<br><br>
          All Elemental Touched have the following traits:
          <ul>
            <li>You retain the Ability Score Increase, Age, Size, Speed, and Language of your origin Race.</li>
            <li>You may also, depending on your origin race, keep the following racial features:
              <ul>
                <li>Dwarves, Elves, and Myr keep their Darkvision.</li>
