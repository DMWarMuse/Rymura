        <h1>Winter Travel</h1>
        <p>These travel rules are in addition to the ones found on the <a href="campaignrules.html#travel">Campaign Rules Page</a>.<br> Travel Pace assumes an 8 hour day over snowy terrain:<br><br>
            On Foot = 3d10+6 miles (Low = 9, Avg = 22.5, High = 36)<br>
            Other forms of travel will need to be discovered or obtained.</p>
            <h6>Winter Weather Modifiers:</h6>
            <p>Calm (Total distance x1)<br>
            Light Weather (Total distance x.8)<br>
            Moderate Weather (Total distance x.6)<br>
            Severe Weather (Total distance x.3)<br>
            Traveling during a blizzard requires a DC15 survival check: On a failure, you veer off-course.</p>

        <h1>Requisitioning and Ordering Supplies</h1>
        <p>(Campaign Specific)<br>
        You may find no stores, shops, or services in the desolate lands of world. Instead, supplies and gear must be crafted, ordered, or requisitioned.</p>
            <h2>Requisitions</h2>
            <p>A military outpost, or frontier camp or town, may have some supplies on hand.  You may try to requisition these supplies from the acting quartermaster.  Your standing with the base personnel, the leader of the camp, and the quartermaster will affect how willing they are to lend you their limited supplies.</p>
            <h2>Ordering Supplies</h2>
            <p>The ship that has brought you to these shores, or the bold traveling peddler, could be hired to make scheduled stops.  You may order supplies when the contact arrives, and when they get back to civilization they will do their best to purchase the items requested.  However, the journey could be long and perilous; It could take weeks before the contact, hopefully, returns with your supplies.  You will have to plan ahead.<br><br>
            If you are looking for less savory items, you may want to find a trusted contact that could make and deliver those purchases for you.</p>
           <span style="opacity: 0.4;">
            <h2>Obtaining Wealth</h2>
            <p>(Only relevant in expedition-type campaigns)<br>During your expeditions you will come across various objects of interest that could be sold to the right person.  This is how you will obtain your wealth in order to purchase supplies, improve the base camp, and hire craftsmen to aid you in your expedition.</p>
           </span>

        <h1>Spell and Skill Restrictions</h1>
        <p>Survival campaigns are meant to emphasize survival, careful planning, and resourcefulness.  To that end, certain skills and spells have been restricted.  This list is not exhaustive, and more items may need to be added as the campaign progresses. As always, the restrictions can be challenged and debated.<br><br>These restrictions are in addition to the ones found on the <a href="charactercreation.html#class-changes-and-restrictions">Campaign Rules Page</a>.</p>
