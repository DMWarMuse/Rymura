            <h2>Subraces</h2>
            <h3>Line of Drome</h3>
              <p>Drome was a warrior of great renown. Afte the First Exodus, he led his clan high into the Silver Wreath mountains, displacing the goblins and elves in the area. The clan made their home by carving directly into the rockface of the mountains and building wooden longhouses. Supplied by their highland farms, the Line of Drome clings fiercely to their traditions and has securely held their idyllic vale for over 2000 years.<br><br>Clan Drome is currently ruled by Berenia, the sixth daughter, who has blood ties to Drome himself.</p>

            <h3>Line of Belgrieg</h3>
              <p>Belgrieg, known as the first builder, pioneered many advancements in dwarven engineering.  His teachings on pulls, levers, and gears during the Age of Legends catapulted his clan into being the best miners in Rymura. Known to the other races as 'The Diggers', Belgriegians get along well with the other humanoid races in the area, even boasting cordial relation with the Tel'Na'Gren.<br><br>Diggers of Clan Belgrieg are renowned for their ability to find, and then mine, various materials both common and rare. Hiring a small team of Belgriegians is expensive, but on a Kingdom level it is a small price to pay for finding marble, silver or other precious deposits.<br><br>Led by their merchant council, Clan Belgrieg practices 'General Apprenticeships'.  Dwarves from age 20-40 are expected to apprentice at a wide variety of crafts before, at the Age of Choosing, they select a profession that suits them. Because most Belgriegians have developed rudimentary skills in many crafts, communities quickly recovery from crises like fires or raids.</p>

            <h3>Line of Gronbauch</h3>
              <p>Prior to the First War of Extermination, Strike Leader Gronbach felt, much like the elves, that they should invade and eliminate their neighbors before they become a problem. Unlike the unified elves, Gronbauch didn't have the backing of his leaders and was exiled from the Dwarven lands. Gronbach led many like-minded dwarves deep underground, eventually establishing a hold and clan. There, deep in their underground fortresses, the Line of Gronbauch plot their revenge against their cousins in the world above. So far, their plotted revenge has not materialized as they constantly struggle against the other denizens of the world below.</p>
