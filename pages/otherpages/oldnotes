 <!-- <h2>Movement and Swimming</h2>
                <h5>Movement</h5>
                <p>A character may only dash once per round, regardless of the source of the dash.<br><br>For example, a rogue may move, attack, and bonus action dash, but may not move, bonus action dash, action dash.<br><br>Expeditious Retreat is the exception to this and permits one additional dash. Haste already increases your speed, so it does not allow any additional dashes.</p>

        <h5>Swimming</h5>
        <p>Swimming is heavily impacted by encumbrance. A character may swim normally as long as they are carrying weight less than or equal to five times their strength score. If a character has more weight on them than five times their strength score, they swim 5ft per round and must sink.
            <br><br>≤ Strx5 | Normal swimming
            They may tread water if they have weight greater than three times their strength score, but less than or equal to five times their strength score.

            <p>Discovering a magic item and learning its use(s) is no easy task.  A short/long rest with the item in your possession may no longer reveal how a magic item works.  You may need to rely on experimentation and the Identify spell (changes below).</p>

            <p><b>Identify:</b>
            <p>Identify casting time is now 1 hour.</p>
              <p>During this time you become perfectly still and enter a trance like state. At the end of the hour you will gleam information on how the magics in the item(s) are arranged, including its schools, and a vauge idea on how the item might be used.  Some experimenting may be needed to test your theory depending on the power level of the magic item.</p>

        <h2>Total Defense</h2>
        <p>Your character concentrates on taking as little damage as possible and takes a defensive stance, either using your weapons to parry incoming attacks, or hiding behind your shield.  When you take this action you cannot move or use Reactions or Bonus Actions, but you gain +4 to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
        <h2>Charging</h2>
        <p>Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and perform a melee attack in the same round. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.</p>
        <h5>Movement During a Charge</h5>
        <p>You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 30 feet directly toward the designated opponent.  You give up any remaining movement after the attack is made.</p>
        <h5>Attacking on a Charge</h5>
        <p>After moving, you may take your melee attack action. You get Advantage to the attack rolls, but take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
        A charging character gets a +5 bonus to Strength checks made to bull rush an opponent (Knock Prone or Knock Back).</p>
        <h5>Lances and Charge Attacks</h5>
        <p>A lance, spear, or trident deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.</p>
        -->

        <!-- <h2>Firing into Melee</h2>
        <p>When firing at an opponent that is engaged in a melee, there is a chance of hitting the wrong target.</p>
        <p>There is a 5% chance of hitting an adjacent creature of a the same size or a size larger.  Roll your attack as normal, and then roll a 1d20, on a 1 the attack hits the adjacent target.  If more than one creature is adjacent to your target, multiply the chance to hit accordingly.</p>
        <p>Example:  Your party members (an elf rouge, and a human fighter) are engaged with a Hobgoblin and an Ogre.  The Elf is on the left side of the Hobgoblin, the Human in front of the Hobgoblin, and the Ogre is on the right side of the Hobgoblin. Your target, the Hobgoblin, is engaged in a melee with 3 other creatures.  Your chance to miss your target and hit a different creature is 15% (Medium Elf +5%, Medium Human +5%, Large Ogre +5%).  Roll a 1d20: 1 targets the Elf, 2 targets the Human, 3 targets ogre, 5-20 targets Hobgoblin (a hit depends on AC).</p>
        <p>Ignore creatures smaller than the targets size when calculating miss chance.</p>
        -->


        <!--<h2>Called Shots</h2>
        <p>Called Shots can be used to perform a difficult task for a mechanical or story reason, such as cutting off someone’s shield strap in the middle of battle, chopping off a minotaur horn that is impaling your companion, or shooting the rope on the bell tower from 300 feet away.</p>
        <p>Called shots are allowed or denied at the discretion of the DM, and group, depending on practicality.</p>-->

old <h2>Encumbrance</h2>
        <p>When using these rules, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, you are encumbered: Your base walking speed is reduced by 5 feet. Saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are made with disadvantage.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 15 times your Strength score, you are instead over-encumbered: Your base walking speed is reduced by 15 feet. In addition, you have disadvantage on Ability Checks and Saving Throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 20 times your Strength score, your base walking speed is reduced by 15 feet. In addition, any Ability Checks or Saving Throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution automatically fail, and all Attack Rolls are made with disadvantage.</p>

Other intelligent races are known to exist but are rare or have little contact with the civilized world.<br><br><!--They are generally found in the wilder places of the continents.<br><br> *Roleplaying as one of these races will affect how people treat and react to you, the more “human/humanoid” you look, the more “normal” the reaction from the general populace. For instance, if you play a Hobgoblin and go into a northern village, you will most likely be met with fear and hostility. In the South you may be treated with wonder and disbelief. I am not trying to discourage you from playing a race, just be prepared from a roleplay point of view.*<br><br>-->

    <h1> Chaos and Order </h1>
          <p>In the beginning, the surface of Terrim was lifeless. Above the heavens two powerful begins struggled.  They did not struggle with malicious intent, or with hate, hope, fear, envy or any such feeling the way mere mortals comprehend things.  They struggled against each other because that is what they were there to do.  Laither - She who is order and Relthar - He who is chaos, the two blind gods of the beginning.  Laither in her infinite prowess would grab the strands of life and magic and braid then into orderly lines, while Relthar unbraided them as was his nature.  Sometimes Laither missed strands of lifeforce and they would filter down the surface of Terrim, where they made contact, life grew.-->
        <!-- <h1> The Warrens </h1>
          <p>Clerical and Magical energies permeate the world through founts of the forces, powers, and components that make up the
              Prime Material Plane. These forces were there during the infancy of the world; pure, and present in all things.<br><br>

              Each source dwells inside a Warren (sometimes called a House or Hold). These Warrens are sub-plane repositories;
              pure representations of the power that resides within. Venture into the Warren of Order and you will be treated to
              straight lines, uniformity, and predictability, where-as the Warren of Purity is a vast un-marked snow-covered
              landscape of peace and contentment.<br><br>

              Each Warren is overseen by an effigy that reflects the power that that Warren is composed of. The Warren of Fate, for example, is presided over by The Inexorable; A being of unstoppable inevitability. The Warren of Destruction, on the other hand, is presided over by The Architect of Ruin; worried about nothing else other than the complete dismantling of all things. These effigies are kept in check by the others in a delicate dance of balance, and they rarely turn their attention outside of their own dominion.<br><br>
              The raw power of a Warren is too much for standard mortals to harness and control; while incredible feats can be performed, in the end the body and mind will shatter. Paragons, Exemplars, and other Higher beings, known colloquially as Gods, temper the flow of the Warrens and disseminate its power to its users.<br><br>

              <i>"The Warrens of the world dwell beyond the planes. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes." ― Tattersail</i></p>
