        <h1>Character Abilities</h1>
        <h2>Movement and Swimming</h2>
        <h5>Movement</h5>
        <p>A character may only dash once per round, regardless of the source of the dash.<br><br>For example, a rogue may move, attack, and bonus action dash, but may not move, bonus action dash, action dash.<br><br>Expeditious Retreat is the exception to this and permits one additional dash. Haste already increases your speed, so it does not allow any additional dashes.</p>

        <h5>Swimming</h5>
        <p>Swimming is heavily impacted by encumbrance. A character may swim normally as long as they are carrying weight less than or equal to twice their strength score. They may tread water if they have weight greater than twice their strength score, but less than or equal to three times their strength. If a character has more weight on them than three times their strength score, they swim 5ft per round and must sink. Do not count buoyant gear in this calculation (wooden staff, water skin, etc.).
            <br><br>≤ Strx2 | Normal swimming
            <br>> Strx2 | Tread water
            <br>> Str x3 | Swim 5ft, only sink</p>
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>So, you’re a smalltime human farmer from western Tarmentis that is just starting our adventuring. How would you possibly have learned Elvish, Dwarvish, or Orcish having never seen such creatures?</p>
        <p>If there is no valid and good reason why your character would know a language, please consider not taking the additional languages granted by background or class.  If you still wish to choose an additional language try the Trade Language, Old Common, Thieves Cant, or Ancient Dwarven outlined in the <a class="a-inline" " href="charactercreation.html">Character Creation Page</a>.</p>
        <h2>Darkvision and Infravision</h2>
        <p>Darkvision/Infravision is an evolutionary trait some races and monsters developed for seeing in complete darkness.  This trait is developed out of necessity by creatures who live in the deep dark places of the world and do not use light sources on a regular basis.  For this reason, some races have had their Darkvision feature removed, reduced, or changed in the <a class="a-inline" href="charactercreation.html">Character Creation Page</a>.</p>

        <h1>Magic</h1>
        <h2>Previous Edition Spells</h2>
        <p>Spells from previous editions (4e, 3e, 2e, etc.) are allowed, encouraged, and may even be used by enemies.  Previous edition spells require DM approval, and they may need to be converted to 5e.</p>
        <h2>Spell, Scroll, and Golem Creation</h2>
        <p>Disregard the RAW for spell, scroll, and golem creation.  These can be achieved through explanation, experimentation, and role play.  Ask the DM for more detailed instructions.</p>
        <h2>Attunement</h2>
        <p>You no longer need to attune to magical items.  In addition, there are no limits on the number of magical items you can have and use unless its physically impossible to utilize them simultaneously (i.e.: two sets of boots) or restricted in the item description.</p>
        <h2 data-toc-text="Dispel Magic">Changes to Dispel Magic</h2>
        <p>Base DC 15 + the spells level, up from 10.</p>
        <h2 data-toc-text="Identify Spell">Changes to the Identify Spell</h2>
        <p>Discovering a magic item and learning its use(s) is no easy task.  A short/long rest with the item in your possession may no longer reveal how a magic item works.  You may need to rely on experimentation and the Identify spell (changes below).</p>
        <p><b>Identify:</b></p>
        <p>Identify casting time is now 1 hour.</p>
        <p>During this time you become perfectly still and enter a trance like state.  If you are disturbed, or if something breaks your concentration, the spell fails and you must start over.  At the end of one hour you will gleam information on how the magics in the item are arranged, including its schools, and how the item might be used.  Some experimenting may be needed to test your theory depending on the power level of the magic item.</p>
        <p>You can opt to fully identify an item by casting the ritual for 8 hours, you cannot be interrupted during this time or you must start over. At the end of the 8 hours, you learn the items properties as you would the RAW Identify spell, you can identify a number of magic items (up to your Intelligence Modifier) using this method.</p>
        <p>Learning what spells are affecting a <i>creature</i> takes the RAW 1 minute.</p>
        <h2>Using Spell Scrolls</h2>
        <p>Any creature can use a spell scroll, but the difficulty is determined by your knowledge of magic.</p>
        <h5>Spell Casters:</h5>
        <p>If your class has spellcasting abilities, and the spell on the scroll is known by your character, no roll is required.<br><br>
        If the spell scroll is a higher level than you can currently cast, or you haven’t learned the particular spell, an Arcana Check is required: the DC is 10 plus the spell level of the scroll.  On a success the spell goes off as normal and the scroll disintegrates. On a failure the spell fizzles, and the scroll disintegrates. </p>
        <h5>Non-Spell Casters:</h5>
        <p>If your class is not a spellcaster an Arcana check will be required to use spell scrolls: The DC is 10 plus the spell level of the scroll.  If you are not proficient in Arcana, make the roll with disadvantage.  On a success the spell goes off as normal and the scroll disintegrates.  On a failure, the magical energies backfire, the scroll disintegrates, and you take a number of d10’s worth of damage per level of the spell scroll (a level 3 spell scroll that backfires will deal 3d10 damage to the reader).</p>

        <h1 data-toc-text="Divine Intervention">Divine Intervention<br>(Beseeching a God):</h1>
        <p>Your character may cry out to a god for help in dire circumstances.  Depending on your standing with that god, he or she could decide to grant you aid.</p>
        <p>The DM will roll a percentile die, in secret, to determine if the god you cry out to agrees to help.  Whether you are a follower of that god, that god’s motives, and the way in which you call for aid, are just some determining factors into if the god will take pity on you or not.  A rousing speech promising servitude and favor will always make a god more willing to act versus demands for help.</p>
        <p>Aid can come in many forms: A champion to aid you in battle, healing, information, or a magic item are just some of the ways a god may choose to help.</p>

        <h1>Combat</h1>
        <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <p>There is a penalty of -2 to hit when using ranged weapons in Moderate or Severe weather.</p>
            <p>Spears and Javelins now have the finesse tag.</p>
            <p>Crossbow does not require a proficiency slot to use.</p>
        <h2>Critical Hits</h2>
        <p>When scoring a critical hit, the first damage die is always maxed.  For example: a greatsword crits for 12+1d12+modifier.</p>
        <h2>Delaying</h2>
        <p>You may delay your action to the end of the round.  After all other creatures in the initiative order have gone, you may take your turn, this is your new position in the initiative order.  If a second character, or creature, has delayed their action, they then move to the bottom of the initiative order.</p>
        <h2>Total Defense</h2>
        <p>Your character concentrates on taking as little damage as possible and takes a defensive stance, either using your weapons to parry incoming attacks, or hiding behind your shield.  When you take this action you cannot use Reactions or Bonus Actions, but you gain +4 to AC for the round.</p>
        <h2>Charging</h2>
        <p>Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack in the same round. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.</p>
        <h5>Movement During a Charge</h5>
        <p>You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 20 feet and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent.  You give up any remaining movement after the attack is made.<br><br>
        You must charge in a straight line (If you are in difficult Terrain like Mud, Snow, or Ice, an Athletics saving throw may be required, on a fail you fall prone and lose your action).  If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you cannot charge that opponent.</p>
        <h5>Attacking on a Charge</h5>
        <p>After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +3 bonus to the attack and damage roll and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
        A charging character gets a +3 bonus to the Strength check made to bull rush an opponent (Knock Prone. or Knock Back 10ft, depending on the opponents opposed Dexterity check).</p>
        <h5>Lances and Charge Attacks</h5>
        <p>A lance, spear, or trident deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.</p>
        <!--
        <h2>Firing into Melee</h2>
        <p>When firing at an opponent that is engaged in melee combat, there is a chance of hitting the wrong target.</p>
        <p>There is a 5% chance of hitting an adjacent Medium or Small creature, and 10% for Large or Larger.  Roll your attack as normal, and then roll a 1d20, on a 1 (or 2 if the adjacent creature is Large) the attack hits the adjacent target.  If more than one creature is adjacent to your target, multiply the chance to hit accordingly.</p>
        <p>Example:  Your party members (an elf rouge, and a human fighter) are engaged with a Hobgoblin and an Ogre.  The Elf is on the left side of the Hobgoblin, the Human in front of the Hobgoblin, and the Ogre is on the right side of the Hobgoblin. Your target, the Hobgoblin, is engaged in a melee with 3 other creatures.  Your chance to miss your target and hit a different creature is 20% (Medium Elf +5%, Medium Human +5%, Large Ogre +10%).  Roll a 1d20: 1 targets the Elf, 2 targets the Human, 3 or 4 targets ogre, 5-20 targets Hobgoblin (a hit depends on AC).</p>
        <p>Ignore creatures smaller than the targets size when calculating miss chance.</p>
    -->
        <h2>Back Attack</h2>
        <p>Back attack on opponent = +2 to hit, ignore shield AC.</p>
        <p>Ranged or Melee, if your character is situated reasonably behind the opponent you gain a +2 bonus to hit, and you ignore the targets shield AC bonus (if applicable).  If you are the opponent’s target, you are not able to move around to the back as the opponent would turn with you.</p>
        <h2>Called Shots</h2>
        <p>Called Shots = -? to hit or DC roll (can vary).</p>
        <p>Called Shots can be used to perform a difficult task for a mechanical or story reason, such as cutting off someone’s shield strap in the middle of battle, chopping off a minotaur horn that is impaling your companion, or shooting the rope on the bell tower from 100 feet away.</p>
        <p>Called shots are allowed or denied at the discretion of the DM, and group, depending on practicality.</p>
        <h2>Potions</h2>
        <p>Drinking a potion is an Action if you retrieve it from your pack.</p>
        <h2>Initiative Modifiers</h2>
        <p>Weapons made of lightweight materials can be wielded slightly faster than their heavier Iron or Steel counterparts, this gives the wielder a small edge in combat.  Applies to Primary weapons only.</p>
        <p>Malachite = +1 to initiative.<br>Mithril = +1 to initiative.<br>Otataral = +2 to initiative.<br>Zardazik = +3 to initiative.</p>

        <h1>Silvered, Consecrated, and Unholy Weapons</h1>
        <p>All Undead are vulnerable to silvered weapons.</p>
        <p>All Demonic creatures are vulnerable to consecrated weapons.</p>
        <p>All Celestial creatures are vulnerable to unholy weapons.</p>
        <p>On a successful hit, Consecrated weapons gain the (optional) benefit of pushing a demonic opponent 5ft away (if the demonic creature is Medium or smaller, and CR 3 or lower).</p>
        <p>Consecrated and Unholy weapons are gained through story and role playing. </p>

        <h1>Healing and Rest</h1>
        <p>While losing “Hit Points” is often describe as taking a physical injury, it is more a representation of your physical fortitude, will to live, and fighting spirit.  Dodging out of the way of an attack, blocking with a shield, getting knocked prone, all of these take a physical toll on the body, even if it does not result in blood loss or injury.</p>
        <p>Spell Slots now come back after a Full Rest. Classes and Skills that allow you regain spell slots on a Short Rest instead regain spell slots on a Long Rest (i.e. Wizard's 'Arcane Recovery' feature, or the Warlock class).</p>
        <h5>Full Rest</h5>
        <p>A full rest is 3 days of light activity/inactivity, it is used when you have had a grueling stretch of days and need to give your body and mind time to fully recover.  At the end of the third day your Hit Points and Hit Dice count are maxed, all Spell Slots refresh.</p>
        <h5>Long Rest</h5>
        <p>A Long Rest is used to sleep and recover from the perils of the day (about 8 hours).  Players can only benefit from 1 Long Rest in a 24-hour period.<br><br>
        During a Long Rest, players may spend up to a number of Hit Dice equal to half of their level (rounded up).<br><br>
        At the end of a Long Rest, the players recover a number of spent Hit Dice depending on their level (see table).<br><br>
        At the end of a Long Rest, the players recover Hit Points equal to their characters Level + CON (minimum 1).</p>
        <h5>Short Rest</h5>
        <p>A Short Rest is used for catching your breath and quickly bandaging any wounds (minimum 20 minutes).  Players can take up to 2 Short Rests in a 24-hour period.<br><br>
        During a Short Rest, players can spend up to a number of Hit Dice depending on their level (see table).</p>

        <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
          <table class="tablecenter">
            <tr><th>Player Level</th><th>HD Recovered on Long Rest<br>Useable on Short Rest</th></tr>
            <tr><td><b>1 - 4</b></td><td>1 Hit Dice</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>5 - 8</b></td><td>2 Hit Dice</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>9 - 12</b></td><td>3 Hit Dice</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>13 - 16</b></td><td>4 Hit Dice</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>17 - 20</b></td><td>5 Hit Dice</td></tr>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h5>Bonuses</h5>
        <p>During a Long Rest, a character proficient in Medicine, and in possession of a Healer’s Kit, may tend up to a number of characters (including themselves) equal to their INT modifier. Each tended player regains Hit Points equal to their characters CON modifier (minimum 1) at the end of the Long Rest.<br><br>
        During a Long Rest, a character proficient in, and in possession of, an Herbalism Kit may tend up to a number of characters (including themselves) equal to their WIS modifier. Each tended player regains Hit Points equal to their characters CON modifier (minimum 1) at the end of the Long Rest.<br><br>
        If a player expends a use of a Healing Kit during a Long or Short Rest, that player (or another player they choose) can spend 1 additional Hit Dice.  A player can only benefit from this bonus once per Short or Long Rest.</p>

        <h1>Death and Unconsciousness</h1>
        <h2>Reduced to 0 HP</h2>
        <p>If you are reduced to 0 hit points during combat and are then brought back above 0 by any method other than a Cleric, Paladin, or Druid spell of level 1 or higher, gain 1 level of exhaustion.<br><br>
        These effects are cumulative, if you are brought back up by a healing potion, knocked unconscious again, then brought back up by another healing potion, you would have gained 2 levels of exhaustion.  If you would gain your 6<sup>th</sup> level of exhaustion in this manner, you are instead considered stabilized and will awake in 2d4 hours.  When you awake, you will have 4 levels of exhaustion remaining.<br><br>
        One level of exhaustion is removed during a long rest.</p>
        <h2>Death and Resurrection</h2>
        <p>If your character has died and is brought back within 60 seconds gain 2 levels of exhaustion.<br><br>
        These effects are cumulative, if your character dies again, and is revived within 60 seconds, you would incur 2 more levels of exhaustion.  If you would gain your 6<sup>th</sup> level of exhaustion in this manner, you are instead considered stabilized and will awake in 2d4 hours.  When you awake, you will have 4 levels of exhaustion remaining.<br><br>
        If your character has been dead for over a minute, you may still be brought back using various other methods (Raise Dead/Reincarnate/Resurrection ect.).  However, pulling a soul back from the domain of Kulindra is a difficult task.  Beseeching a priest or priestess of Kulindra to help will make the processes much smoother, or perhaps a cleric of a different god can beseech their deity for aid.  A soul may still be resurrected against the will of the gods, but they can be fickle, and consequences could follow.</p>

        <h1>Traveling and Encumbrance</h1>
        <h2>Encumbrance</h2>
        <p>When using these rules, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means you travel at 2/3 your maximum speed when out of combat. In addition, all saving throws that use Dexterity are made with disadvantage.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means you move at 1/2 your maximum speed in and out of combat. In addition, saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are made with disadvantage.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 15 times your Strength score, you are instead over-encumbered, which means you move at 1/3 your maximum speed in and out of combat. In addition, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.<br><br>
        If you carry weight in excess of 20 times your Strength score, your in-combat movement is 5ft, you outside of combat movement is 1/10. In addition, any ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution automatically fail.</p>
        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>Travel Pace assumes an 8 hour day on non-rough terrain:<br><br>
        On Foot = 3d10+6 miles (Low = 9, Avg = 22.5, High = 36)<br>
        On Horseback = 4d12+6 miles (Low=10, Avg = 30, High = 54)<br>
        Cart and Horse = 4d10+4 miles (Low = 8, Avg = 26, High = 44)</p>
        <h6>Speed Modifiers:</h6>
        <p>Traveling over Difficult Terrain (Total distance x.5)<br>
        Sneaking or Searching for something during travel (Total distance x.5)<br>
